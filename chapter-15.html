<h3> Chapter 15 </h3>
<p>She agrees to tell me what she knows, but on her suggestion we begin to walk quickly away from the clearing. I snatch up the unfired assault rifle from the grass as we move.</p>
<p>	"They will come and check out those gunshots soon enough. Once they find the bodies, they will know I am still alive and come looking for me," Sara says as we break into a jog. My body aches from all the recent injuries I have sustained, but I keep up with her pace.</p>
<p>	"Ya, I don't know if they are actually searching for me, but I have run into these guys a few times already. I was lucky enough to make it out alive," I add between breaths.</p>
<p>	"You look like you have been through a lot," Sara says to me, indicating my wounds.</p>
<p>	We come upon a construction site sitting idly between some short buildings. It is a perfect place for us to hole up, at least for a little while. We duck beneath some yellow caution tape and make our way into the unfinished building.</p>
<p>	A large white sign says, "Future Home of the Bakersville Bank North Branch." Four levels of the building have been constructed already and the pillars for a fifth are in place, but right now the structure looks similar to a concrete parking garage. Stairwells at both levels lead up to the higher platforms.</p>
<p>	I suggest to Sara, "We should move to the top level of this construction site. It will give us a good view of the area, and we can watch if anyone is coming. Also, it will be a good place to get some rest." Sara agrees and we make our way to the top level.</p>
<p>	The climb up the stairs is strenuous due to my injured leg and the adrenaline of combat wearing off. Sara put her arm underneath my own and offers to help me make it up the stairs.</p>
<p>	"Thank you," I say to her.</p>
<p>	"You're very welcome. It is the least I can do," Sara replies.</p>
<p>	As soon as we make it to the top level, a bolt of lightning streaks across the sky. The flash is quickly followed by a loud rumble of thunder. In all the excitement, I had not noticed the sky was becoming so dark.  Rain begins to spot on the concrete of the construction site, and swiftly grows into a downpour.</p>
<p>	"So much for the top floor," I say, turning around to head back down the stairs. "We should camp out on the next lowest floor instead. It will at least give us some cover from this rain."</p>
<p>	We make it to the lower floor and look around for the most comfortable place to sit, but our options for comfort are limited. Wherever we decide to settle in needs to be a ways back from the edge. If we get too close to the edge of the building, someone might be able to see us from the  ground even in this storm.</p>
<p>	A shoulder-high stack of pipes, that look as though they will be used to send plumbing through the building, sit in a corner of the unfinished building close to one of the support pillars. They are covered by a dark green tarp. I pull the tarp off of the pipes, and we sit with our backs to them, looking out into the storm.</p>
<p>	I use the tarp to cover our legs, and it only grants us a small amount of warmth from the cold wind of the storm, but it is better than nothing. I can feel Sara begins to shiver next to me. It is probably not only the cold, but what just happened to her that is making her shiver. She scoots closer to me until the sides of our bodies are touching.</p>
<p>	She looks at me and asks, "Is it okay if I sit closer to you? I know I just met you, but I'm cold and scared." I nod my head and place my arm around her neck.</p>
<p>	This is crazy. If I had seen a girl like this a few weeks ago, I probably would not have had the courage to even introduce myself to her. The situation we are in is totally messed up, but I guess one good thing has come from it.</p>
<p>	"Do you want me to go first or do you want to?" she asks me.</p>
<p>	"What do you mean?" I ask, slightly distracted by my thoughts.</p>
<p>	"Do you want to explain how you got here first or do you want to explain how I got put into that storage facility first?" she answers.</p>
<p>	"I can go first," I say to her. She lays back against the pipes with my arm around her neck. Lightning flashes, sending a bolt of illumination across the rainswept field stretching in front of the unfinished building.</p>
<p>	"Your story is probably more exciting than mine. You look like you have been through a lot with all those injuries," Sara says.</p>
<p>	I tell her my whole story as she listens intently. I begin with the gunshot victim in the restaurant. I guess that is where all this began so that is where I should start. It seems like so long ago even though it was only a few days. When I tell her about the wounds I received, she winces and wants to see my bandages.</p>
<p>	When I finish telling my story she says, "Wow, it is amazing that you are still alive. Lucky for me you hadn't died before you stumbled onto me." She laughs nervously, and I can tell she is thinking about what would have happened to her if I had not come along when I did.</p>
<p>	After thinking it over for a moment she says, "You must have been asleep for around two days in that holding cell. Your story only accounts for a two days passage of time, but this is the fourth day since the attack started."</p>
<p>	"That would account for the reason I felt so disoriented after waking up yesterday. Alright, your turn now," I say. "Maybe your story added to mine will help us make a little more sense of this situation."</p>
