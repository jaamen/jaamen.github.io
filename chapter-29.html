<h3> Chapter 29 </h3>
<p>John and I ditch the car we stole on the outskirts of downtown. We found the empty vehicle sitting next to the road with the keys inside, and figured driving would be much faster than walking since the silhouette of the Bakersville Bank Tower was barely visible in the distance when we first started.</p>
<p>Besides, I am sure the owner of the vehicle has a lot more to worry about besides the state of his or her car.</p>
<p>	We exit the car and begin walking down the street, making our way toward the downtown skyscrapers shrouded in the early morning mist. We still have about a mile to walk, but know that the closer we get to Rasputin's headquarters, the more patrols there will be canvasing the area.</p>
<p>	Two men walking through the half-destroyed downtown will find many more places to hide from the patrols than a car will.</p>
<p>	With our eyes peeled for any sign of patrols, we come ever closer to our destination. Along the way, John demonstrates to me how to reload my weapons.</p>
<p>	"So this Rasputin and Doctor Stefan were planning on putting chips in the heads of the members of Congress that he is holding hostage in order to control them? This was a very elaborate plan." John asks me on our trek.</p>
<p>	I reply, "I have run the same thing over in my head many times since those men grabbed me from my apartment. Doctor Stefan made it clear that the takeover of the city did not really matter, and  was mostly a cover-up so they could plant the behavioral modification chips in a majority of the members of Congress without alerting the authorities. Thanks to the Hyde Rule, they were able to take over the city for a week while the free members of Congress argued."</p>
<p>	John nods his head and says, "Maybe one of us will get a chance to ask Rasputin just why he did this when we save our friends." After a few more minutes of walking, we are now only a few blocks away from to the looming heights of the Bakersville Bank Tower.</p>
<p>	The building rises high above all the others in downtown, and the top is nearly invisible due to the thick morning fog. We have to hunker down behind a wrecked car as a black SUV drives past. It reminds me off my first escape from the hands of the attacking soldiers.</p>
<p>	We move from our hiding place and are now in the midst of giant canyons created by towering skyscrapers on all sides of us. We turn the corner of a shorter skyscraper and the building we seek stands in front of us, stretching into the sky.</p>
<p>	A car with all the windows broken out lies half in and half out of the building beside us. The driver must have lost control and smashed into the building, leaving debris from the vehicle and the wall scattered on the ground. We crouch behind the wrecked vehicle to get a better view of what we are up against.</p>
<p>	The perimeter of the Bakersville Bank Tower is surrounded by a newly added chain link fence that stretches out for the length of a regular city block and surrounds all sides of the building. Guards stand everywhere inside and out of the fence, patrolling and checking in with one another. There is absolutely no way we would be able to sneak past them and make it into the building without being seen.</p>
<p>	"We won't be able to make it through the front doors without killing about forty people first. Most likely they would overpower us before we took down even ten soldiers, though. Do you have any other ideas?" I say to John, hoping he might have a plan B.</p>
<p>	Once again, we duck low as two black SUV's speed past us and fly down the street heading away from the Tower.</p>
<p>	John replies, "Maybe. Those trucks have to be coming out of somewhere. They are definitely not driving up the front lawn. They could be parked in the back, but I doubt they would go through that much trouble out here in the open. I know the Tower has an attached parking garage for its employees to use, and I bet that is where the vehicles are going in and out. If we find it fast enough, maybe we can even stop them from getting our friends into the building."</p>
<p>	I nod my head. Seems reasonable enough. I am so glad to have someone else out here fighting with me and giving me ideas. Much better than trying to go it alone.</p>
<p>	Staying hidden, we wait a few minutes. After a while, two more black SUV's drive past, except these are headed toward the Tower. Keeping low, we move closer to the area they are headed. Once we are a city block away from a parking garage they enter, John and I put our backs up against a stalled car sitting in the road.</p>
<p>	Leveling his rifle over the hood of the vehicle, John uses his scope to get a better look at the structure. John says to me, "That is the parking garage attached to the building alright. I will bet they are using the tunnel that connects the garage to the skyscraper to move troops and supplies. Let's watch for a little bit and see if any more vehicles come in or go out."</p>
<p>	The parking garage is located a block away from the Bakersville Bank Tower. It is hidden from the view of the soldiers patrolling the concrete area surrounding the towering skyscraper by a maintenance building.</p>
<p>	I nod my head in agreement to John's words, and we wait for a few minutes until a large truck painted with camouflage drives past and enters the parking garage. A metal chain gate raises to let the vehicle into the structure and lowers afterwards, locking itself securely into the ground.</p>
<p>	Staying low and making sure no one is watching, we sprint from our hiding place behind the car until we are in the alley right next to the garage. Panting, we wait again to make sure no alarm is raised due to our movement. The dingy alley is empty except for two large green dumpsters.</p>
<p>	Scanning the side of the parking garage, I see the concrete parking garage alternates solid concrete and empty air about every ten feet from the ground to the top of the building. There are four open layers, meaning there are probably four floors. The bottom layer of concrete sits next to us, blocking our view of the inside of the building.</p>
<p>	The first open layer is covered by a thick steel grate, most likely to force anyone wanting to enter or exit the garage to do so at the front gate, where they would be seen by the cameras.</p>
<p>	Good way to keep away the homeless and car thieves, but not so good for us.</p>
<p>	John and I climb onto one of the dumpsters, and it is just tall enough for us to be at eye level with the gap in the concrete.</p>
<p>	Inside, a pile of smashed cars sit mangled in the corner.</p>
<p>	Those must have been the cars that were already parked here. They probably used one of the heavier trucks to push them out of the way to give the soldiers more room to maneuver.</p>
<p>	In the parking spaces, twenty military trucks and SUV's sit motionless. The bullet ridden truck that carried the captives from the forest lies empty in one of the stalls.</p>
<p>	We are too late to stop them from getting into the building. Who knows what they are doing to them in there. We have to save them no matter what.</p>
<p>	Pain wrenches my gut as thoughts of Sara in the hands of these monsters flash through my head. Okay, focus now so you can save her and the other resistance fighters.</p>
<p>	Six men wearing either camouflage or black body armor mill around the trucks looking like they are awaiting orders. Two more are stationed at the front gate watching for any incoming trouble. I need to get inside, but it will not be easy with all these guards around. I have weapons, but I would rather not use them if unnecessary.</p>
<p>	Coming up with a plan, I say, "John, you cover me from here. Once I am inside the building, I want you to find a way into another skyscraper with a view of the Bakersville Bank Tower. Try and find our friends using the scope of your rifle. Also, you can give me cover from outside of the building."</p>
<p>	John says, "That is a brilliant idea, Mark. The glass on this particular skyscraper is not mirrored so I should be able to see inside from a distance. Take one of these with you, and I will let you know what building I go up in. Then you should stay towards the side of the building that is closest to me. That way I will be able to give you the best cover."</p>
<p>	He pulls a hand held radio out of his pack and places it in my hand. "Now we will be able to communicate. Good luck, Mark."</p>
<p>	"Thanks. Good luck to you too, John," I say and climb off the dumpster.</p>
<p>	I move to the end of the alley so I am able to look out onto the street. For a while nothing moves in the still morning air blanketing the city.</p>
<p>	This is so bizarre. Usually about this time of day, rush hour traffic is crammed together on this street, and people are hurrying to make it to their offices on time. Now, the whole city is empty except for enemy soldiers with guns.</p>
<p>	A large military truck turns a corner a few blocks down, breaking the silence of the city. Its engine roars as it shifts gears and heads toward the parking garage.</p>
<p>	"John, can you hear me?" I say into my radio. A short moment later there is a crackle and then I hear, "Loud and clear, Mark."</p>
<p>	I continue, "Okay, I am going to hitch a ride in the back of the approaching truck so be ready to cover me when it parks."</p>
<p>	The truck nears, and it is solid dark green with a canopy covering the contents the back. I hope this truck is not full of soldiers coming back from battle. The vehicle briefly stops outside of the garage while the driver checks in with the guard standing closest to the security gate control.</p>
<p>	While they are distracted, I move swiftly and stay low until I am right behind the truck. I scramble up into the back of the vehicle with my pistol ready in case it is occupied, but am relieved to only be met by a bunch of supply crates.</p>
<p>	The second after I get inside, I feel the vehicle moving once again. After a short distance, the truck lurches to a halt. The vehicle's door opens and then closes, echoing loudly in the concrete structure. I lift up a corner of the canvas flap just enough to see out into the parking garage.</p>
<p>	From my place of cover, I can see John sitting with his rifle on the opposite side of the structure. I push my radio and whisper to him, "Can you see me? I am in the back of the truck that just parked."</p>
<p>	Through the radio, John replies in a firm quiet voice as if he is already preparing himself to start shooting, "Good, you made it in. Ya, I can see you. What do you plan to do now?"</p>
<p>	I answer, "I can see the door into the bank from here. I have to find a way to get into the door without being noticed, and without having to shoot everyone in the parking garage."</p>
<p>	"Be ready, I am going to distract the guards to get you inside." John says.</p>
<p>	"Okay, but make sure not to put yourself in danger," I say.</p>
<p>	Seconds later, I hear John banging on the side of the trashcan outside. The noise echoes loudly through the parking garage. All of the soldiers instinctively ready their weapons.</p>
<p>	John yells to the soldiers, "Come and get me!"</p>
<p>	His voice is amplified and almost sounds ethereal in the concrete filled garage. The soldier closest to the gate presses the button to raise it, and then all of them, except for one, rush outside to find the source of the noise.</p>
<p>	Hoping that John can get away safely, I ponder what to do about the one remaining guard. He stands directly between me and the door leading to the tower. His assault rifle is held firmly at his shoulder, and looks very nervous since he is the only one left to defend the garage from attack.</p>
<p>	Thinking the way he will be attacked is from the entrance of the garage, the soldier has his eyes locked onto it. I might be able to sneak up behind him. Any moment, he could turn his head and see me coming at him, though. I will have to be very careful not to alert him if I want to make it past him without needing to take his life, or losing mine.</p>
<p>	I exit the back of the truck, slowly lowering my feet to the ground to avoid making any noise. I move within ten feet of him, and he is still unaware of my presence. When I am directly behind him, only five feet away, the soldier suddenly turns his head to scan the rest of the parking garage.</p>
<p>	As soon as I see the soldier turn his head, I dive at him, knowing he will spot me. My body connects with his at the same moment he realizes he is not alone in the garage. With no time to pull the trigger on his weapon, it falls unfired to the concrete floor. Taken completely by surprise, the soldier has no time to create a defense, and I punch him square in the face as hard as I can.</p>
<p>	The soldiers eyes roll back in his head, and he lies motionless on the ground. I check his pulse to make sure I did not kill him, and am relieved to find his heart still beating. Quickly searching through his gear for anything useful, I find a cylindrical object that reads, "M84 Stun Grenade." This should definitely come in handy. I throw his assault rifle over my shoulder just in case.</p>
<p>	I move over to the sliding glass doors that lead out of the garage. A sign next to them says, "This Way to the Bakersville Bank Tower." The glass door slides open and I step inside. The concrete floor turns into elegant marble the moment I cross the threshold. I have my eyes peeled for any cameras, ready to shoot them out if necessary.</p>
<p>	Halfway down the hall, a bright white light suddenly begins to flash and a loud klaxon type alarm fills my ears. In front of me, a gate at the end of the hall springs into motion from the ceiling and begins heading toward the floor.</p>
<p>	Someone must have spotted me on a security camera, or set off the alarm since John made so much noise. If that gate shuts with me on this side, I will be trapped in this parking garage, helpless to make it into the tower and save my friends.</p>
<p>	I begin to sprint towards the gate which is fifty feet in front of me and closing fast. The siren in the enclosed hallway is deafening, and the flashing white lights hurt my eyes, leaving white streaks in them when I blink. I arrive at the gate when it is only two feet above the floor.</p>
<p>	Using the momentum from my sprint, I fall to the ground and slide on the slick marble floor. I pass under the gate and feel the heavy metal object sweep through my hair seconds before it rattles to the floor. I come to a halt on the other side, and hear the gate lock into place, sealing off the parking garage from the rest of the building.</p>
<p>	My chest heaving from the exertion, I say into my radio, "John, did you get away from those guards? Also, what happened? I almost got cut in half by a security gate!"</p>
<p>	The radio chirps back, "I am fine. It was easy to lose my pursuers in the destruction of downtown. Are you inside the building?"</p>
<p>	"Ya, I made it past the gate. Just barely," I respond.</p>
<p>John continues, "They must be locking down the building. The Bakersville Bank Tower has a built-in lock down protocol. It was put in place to prevent bombings or thefts long before Rasputin showed up. I am guessing that is another reason he chose this structure. He can seal off the building whenever he wants if there is a perceived threat. I do not know if the building was locked down because a soldier following me radioed it in, or if they saw you on a security camera. Be careful in there."</p>
<p>	"Alright, I will be. You be careful as well, John," I say into the radio before putting it in my pocket.	</p>
<p>	A set of steel doors sit in front of me that read, "Bakersville Bank." I scan the wall and ceiling around me and find the hallway on the parking garage side devoid of cameras. Security may be lax here, but being a bank, I am sure it will get much tighter the farther in I go.</p>
<p>	I push open the steel doors and find myself in a long hallway wide enough for a car to drive through. The floors are black marble and light brown stone walls run three fourths of the way up to the ceiling. The rest of the wall and the roof are smooth and white. Long florescent lights turn the space into a brightly lit area.</p>
<p>	The first security camera I have seen sits fifteen feet away, situated in a metal holder hanging a few inches down from the ceiling. Its lens is aimed directly at the door I just opened, so I quickly take aim and squeeze off a shot from my silenced pistol.</p>
<p>	The bullet flies true, and broken glass and camera parts fall to the marble floor below. They may know something is coming since their cameras will be going dark, but at least they will not know it is only one person. If they think a larger force is attacking they may be more cautious, and hopefully John can find a way to distract at least some of the soldiers. Then they will not send a whole army down here to finish me off.</p>
<p>	The next camera is fifteen feet beyond the second one, but points in the opposite direction. Looking farther down the long hallway, which ends in a spot where the hall turns a corner, I can see cameras every fifteen feet, alternating direction the entire way down.</p>
<p>	That must give them camera coverage of the entire hallway. Anyone watching those cameras will know my progress into the building. I have to try and find the security room where these cameras are being viewed, and neutralize whoever is inside. I do not want Rasputin to have any idea I am coming for him.</p>
<p>	I move slowly down the hallway, shooting out the cameras on the ceiling as soon as they come into range. It usually takes me two shots before I am able to hit the small camera. When my gun is empty, I eject the clip and replace it with a fresh one I took from the soldiers in the forest.</p>
<p>	Halfway down the hall, I hear the sound of boots moving quickly toward me, echoing in the long tunnel. Knowing they will turn the corner ahead and spot me any second, I try to think fast.</p>
<p>	It sounds like a large group of soldiers. They must be coming to take out whoever is shooting out their cameras. I will not be able to take them all on with my pistol or assault rifle. I need to figure out a way to get behind them and into the building. Then maybe I will be able to find the security office to stop anyone else from watching me on the cameras.</p>
<p>	Ignoring the few remaining cameras in this section of the hallway, I sprint the rest of the distance to the corner situated between the hall I am in and the one filled with soldiers. Taking the stun grenade out of my pocket I pull the pin and toss it around the corner at the sound of the boots striking the marble floor.</p>
<p>	I plug my ears, close my eyes, and wait for the explosion. The shock wave feels like a punch in the chest, and the sound makes my ears ring even though they were covered. The second after the explosive detonates, I turn the corner and run through the chaos. I keep my weapon raised in case any of the soldiers are clear headed enough to fight back.</p>
<p>	My blind toss with the stun grenade must have been nearly perfect because all fifteen of the soldiers either lay sprawled on the ground rubbing their eyes or stand groping for the nearest wall. Every one of them is too disoriented to see me, and I run right past without being noticed.</p>
<p> I see a security badge attached to a soldier laying on the floor and snatch it off of him as I run by. This might come in handy on my search for the security room where they are watching the cameras. These soldiers will come to their senses soon and come looking for me. I have to keep moving.</p>
<p>	After traveling a few more feet and moving past an open set of double doors, I cross into the lobby of the Bakersville Bank Tower. Sitting in front of me is a massive open marble area, complete with eight stone pillars supporting the vaulted ceiling. The room is empty except for a few sets of tables and chairs in the corners, and a circular desk in the middle of the room.</p>
<p>	There is a sign on the front of the desk which says "Visitors Please Check In," and is marked with the Bakersville Bank logo. Everyone who is usually standing guard in this room must be down the hallway trying to recover from the stun grenade.</p>
<p>	A row of elevators sit opposite the front doors separated by the desk. Card sensors are situated on the wall next to them. I need some kind of security card to use the elevators. Good thing I grabbed one off of those soldiers.</p>
<p>	After quickly scanning the area, I spy a door with a placard next to it that reads, "Security." Approaching it, I put my ear up to the door and can hear voices on the other side. A card reader next to the door has a red indicator light on it, and the door is locked tight.</p>
<p>	I pass the security card over the card reader. The LED in the top corner of the small black square turns from red to green, and I hear a click inside the door handle. The voices coming from the other side of the door stop as soon as I throw the door open.</p>
<p>	Four men sit inside the office among a multitude of video screens. They all look up in shock and surprise as I aim an assault rifle in their faces. Before I pull the trigger, I notice that none of the men are armed. All four men put their hands up in the air and the look of fear on their faces is palpable.</p>
<p>	These men might not even be soldiers, but I do not have time to find out or free them if they are innocent. They will be safe in here after I lock them in whether they are soldiers or not.</p>
<p>	One wall of the room is completely covered with security monitors. They show every area of the building to the people who are watching. A few of them are dark indicating the cameras I had already taken out. These men must watch the monitors and then radio the guards about anything suspicious.</p>
<p>	"Give me your radios and I will not hurt you," I say to the men in a commanding voice.</p>
<p>	Each one of them hands me their radios without saying a word. I toss them outside of the room so they can not reach them.</p>
<p>	On the wall, a thick bundle of wires travels from the floor to the ceiling and runs from the monitors to the exterior of the room via the roof. Those wires probably connect the monitors to all of the cameras throughout the building. I switch weapons to my pistol and fire a shot into the thick tangle of cords.</p>
<p>	Half of the monitors suddenly go dark. The men in the room flinch at the shot but otherwise remain motionless. After two more rounds from my pistol all the monitors now only display black screens.</p>
<p>	Without saying another word to the men inside the room, I turn and fire a round into the card reader on the inside of the security office. Then I move outside and let the door swing shut behind me. I check the door handle and find that it is stuck fast. With no way to swipe cards to exit the room, the men are effectively locked inside the security office.</p>
<p>	Now I can move around the building freely without having to worry about anyone watching me. After I take the elevator up, no one will know where I am in the building.
<p>	I will not have to look far, because I know right where I can find Rasputin. If he is a big enough megalomaniac to use the tallest building in the city as his base, then I am sure I will find him on the very top floor.</p>
