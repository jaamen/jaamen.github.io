<h3> Chapter 32 </h3>
<p> The moment I enter the room, Rasputin steps away from the wall he was leaning against. He brandishes a large revolver in his hand. There is no look of surprise on his face, only a large, creepy grin.</p>
<p>"Hello, Mark," he says with a thick Russian accent, "I have been expecting you."</p>
<p>	He walks a few steps closer to the captives as I move closer to the side of the long boardroom table that separates me from him. Rasputin commands the captives to turn around and face me. I see the faces of my friends, and they look rattled but unharmed. Paul looks defiant, but the rest of them look terrified. Their hands are bound behind them.</p>
<p>	"Drop the gun and I promise not to kill you," I say with authority.</p>
<p>	Rasputin only laughs and says, "Why don't you drop your gun, or I will start shooting your friends right in front of you. It seems you have more to lose in the immediate situation than I do."</p>
<p>	A visible shudder goes through the group of captured resistance fighters at his words.</p>
<p>	"If you shoot a single one of these people, I will shoot you right out the window," I respond. I would shoot him right now, but my friends are standing right in front of him. Firing at him would risk hitting one of them.</p>
<p>	Rasputin grabs the closest hostage to him and puts his gun to her head. The hostage he grabs happens to be Sara. Tears stream down her beautiful face. A chunk of ice hits my gut.</p>
<p>	"Put your gun down now, or I blow her head off," Rasputin commands. He continues, "I promise not to shoot you until I have said my piece."</p>
<p>	"Alright, calm down," I say.</p>
<p>	Courageously, I set my pistol on the boardroom table in front of me and back a step away. Good thing I still have John covering me with his rifle in case Rasputin decides to shoot me. I could not let him shoot Sara or any one of these resistance fighters. I would rather take a bullet than let them get hurt.</p>
<p>	"Glad you listened to reason, let's chat for a bit," Rasputin says and releases Sara. Thankfully, he does not shoot me the second I put down my gun.</p>
<p>	Trying to buy some time, and also because I want to know the answer, I ask, "As long as we are talking, why did you do it? Why bring all this destruction and death to the city? Did you really think you could control the United States Government with chips that alter someone's mind?"</p>
<p>	I decide to play all my cards and let him know just how much of his plan I have discovered thanks to Doctor Stefan. Maybe if he thinks I told others about the secrets of his plan, he might keep me alive long enough to find out who I told about his diabolical aspirations.</p>
<p>	Rasputin answers, "Power. I did it for power. Also, I have already succeeded in controlling the Government to a lesser degree. This would be just one more step toward complete control. How do you think I was able to gather so many members of Congress in one place with a ridiculous financial summit? How do you think I was able to have Congress pass the Hyde Bill?"</p>
<p>	He continues, "Let me tell you why I did it, and maybe you will come to agree with me.</p>
<p>	"I doubt it," I say to him, "but continue."</p>
<p>	He nods his head and says, "The leaders of this country are completely inept at dealing with crises. Partisan arguing in the government leads them to achieve almost nothing. The poor suffer, while the rich get richer, thanks to the rich paying for favorable laws to be past. This country is failing its people for these reasons, among many others."</p>
<p>	"I wanted to fix all that, with me and my people leading the way. We would have ultimate power to do whatever we wanted with this nation. The illusion of Democracy would still be there, but this country would benefit from some stronger leadership in the form of an unseen ruler who wanted to help the less fortunate and keep the wealthy from ruling this nation."</p>
<p>	"The plan was quite complex, but I had enough resources to make it a reality. Once I discovered Doctor Stefan and his behavioral modification chip, I knew the plan would work. My people, mostly hired mercenaries from all corners of the globe whose leaders were planted with the chip, infiltrated the homes of numerous key members of Congress. Once there, they clandestinely implanted the members of Congress with the chip and made them loyal to me."</p>
<p>	"The implanted members of Congress were given instructions to follow my orders exactly, while at the same time never allowing anyone to discover that they had been implanted. Some of the time we had to implant family or staff members as well, so the presence of the chip could be kept a secret. I could not let anyone know what we were doing."</p>
<p>	"I knew it was impossible to plant a large number of Congress in a reasonable amount of time, so I arranged for Bakersville to host a financial summit that would call a large number of Congressional members to the city. After getting the Hyde Bill passed through Congress, thanks to President McDonald's bumbling and my members of Congress implanted with the chip, we would take over Bakersville."</p>
<p>	"I knew we would be safe from the military for a least a short while, thanks to the Hyde Bill. Congress is so slow at deciding how to act due to partisan bickering anyway, that I knew the members of Congress outside of the city could not come to an agreement about how to save the city in less than a week. So, I gathered all of my mercenaries and we took over the city. It was actually not too difficult once we disable the cell phone networks and captured the local army reserve base."</p>
<p>	"Speaking of President McDonalds bumbling, part of the reason the Hyde Bill was put into effect was thanks to me. I manufactured a crisis in a third world country that the United States President could not help but send troops in to provide aid. We made him believe it was so urgent he did not have time to wait for a Congressional decision."</p>
<p>	"Once troops were there, the military intervention of the United States made the situation much worse, and that is when the true human rights violations occurred. The situation was designed to look like the President was only trying to further his own personal agenda of getting re-elected by sending troops and the situation ended in disaster."</p>
<p>	"As planned, it was a debacle. The citizens of the United States were not happy the President had sent troops on his own accord. Your President's approval ratings fell through the floor, and he was almost impeached. The media networks had a field day and tore him to pieces."</p>
<p>	"The people of the United States wanted to make sure troops could not be sent anywhere by the President for personal reasons again. One of my implanted congressmen, John Hyde, proposed the new Hyde Bill, only allowing action of the military with support of congress. After a little lobbying, and a few more implanted individuals, the bill passed easily."</p>
<p>	"The government of this country has become so inept, this once great nation is almost in collapse. It was a bittersweet day for me when I realized I could make the United States military wait a week before responding to a crises such as this, even in one of their own beloved cities."</p>
<p>	"I was going to use the factory you destroyed to make enough behavioral modification chips to plant in all the members of Congress that I am holding hostage. Unfortunately, I was only able to implant around half of them since you burned down the factory and destroyed the plans for the chip. It makes me very angry, but enough of them should have received the chip that it should not matter. Also, I still have a few chips in my possession and you will find out how I am going to use them soon enough."</p>
<p>	Even though he is talking animatedly and very fast, I interject with a question, "What about term limits. Members of the Senate only serve for six years and members of the House only serve for two years. I know they can be reelected, but how would you make sure the government stays loyal to you?</p>
<p>	Rasputin answers, "Once I am in control of the government, it will be easy to set up some sort of secret initiation process where the chip is implanted in new members of Congress by my loyal subjects that are already there. Maybe I can even set up one for the President elected after Mr. McDonald. Don't worry, Mark, I have thought of everything."</p>
<p>	"Now where was I? Oh, yes. I was just about to tell you how you fit into my plan," Stefan continues. "The entire country will hate me for taking over this city if I were to let you or your friends tell them about me. In order to avoid this, I am going to use you and your friends here to further my purposes."</p>
<p>	"I am going to have you and all of these people implanted with the mind control chips. I will slink into the shadows after you are loyal to me and let you become the saviors of the city. The nation will think you liberated this city and will look up to and follow you."</p>
<p>	"The persons freeing this city will be seen as heroes throughout the nation and receive nearly unlimited praise and support. People will listen to them, and they would be very influential. With a majority of Congress implanted with the chip and people devoted to you, because everyone loves an underdog, the masses will fall right in line." </p>
<p>	"Even people distrustful of the government would be devoted to an every man type of hero. They will listen to him and his ideas, and he could sway the opinions of many. There is no limit to what we could achieve with this double edged approach."</p>
<p>	"With the majority of the nation giving their support to me we could eventually control the entire country. Then we would fix the problems of an inept government who does not get anything useful done. We would stop the rich from getting richer and holding all the power. We would stop Congress from only passing laws that benefit the wealthiest people in this country. We could make this country great once more!"</p>
<p>	I look at him in disbelief. I let the words he has just uttered sink in and then think them over. He sounds absolutely crazy, but his plan could have been successful if I had not blown up the factory or made it in here.</p>
<p>	It is true, the government of this country has not run the smoothest lately. Lobbyists use their money to get what they want done in Congress and, most of the time, people with little money are the ones who suffer. Republicans and Democrats argue over unimportant things, causing beneficial laws to fall by the wayside. If the majority of this nation was in agreement, we could fix some of these problems.</p>
<p>	Even with that said, there is no way I agree with his methods. This man is sick and I would rather have a slow and sometimes unfair government than one ran by someone like this. I stare at him and say, "You are nuts. Let us go and we will not tell anyone of your plans."</p>
<p>	Rasputin continues, "I can not allow that. Some of my men are on the way here to help me implant the chip in you. You will be my hero, and then I can order all my troops to stand down right now. There will be no more fighting or killing. Then I will let you and your friends go free. The only thing I will need you to do is let me implant you and your friends with a mind control chip so I know I will have your full loyalty."</p>
<p>	While he says this, he becomes more and more animated, making sweeping gestures with his hands. He begins to walk in front of the pane of glass, and I hope that John can get a bead on Rasputin through the window. My eyes never leave the pistol he is holding. He finishes his rant and faces the window. I can not advance towards him or retrieve my weapon from the table, because he can still see my reflection in the glass.</p>
<p>	I am unarmed and Rasputin could change him mind about implanting us and shoot me or my friends at any time. Going along with his plan could stop all the fighting, but the cost is too great. What he does not know is that John has him in the cross hairs of his rifle, and that resistance fighters are on their way to stop his troops. He thinks he is holding all the cards right now, but he is very wrong. The only problem is I need to get the hostages out of the line of fire.</p>
<p>	I say to him, "No, I will never go along with what you want. This country is great, and though it has its flaws and does need some change, murdering innocent people and destroying one of its great cities is not the way to go about that change. Sometimes people just need to stand up for what is right."</p>
<p>	Winking at Paul as I speak these words, I see understanding on his face. Rasputin is unable to see my wink in the reflection of the glass.</p>
<p>	"Down, now!" I yell, as I dive toward the long boardroom table. Paul grasps the two people standing next to him and all three of them fall to the ground in a heap.</p>
<p>	I scoop up my weapon from the table as I slide across, but Rasputin already has his weapon pointed at me. I do not have enough time to level my weapon at him before Rasputin can fire his revolver. I brace for the shot, but none comes from his pistol. A bullet hole appears in the window behind him, sending cracks through the glass pane. The look of surprise on his face contorts to one of extreme pain, and he falls to the floor.</p>
<p>	A crimson blood stain appears beneath him on the green carpet. John's shot was true and none of the hostages are hurt. Dropping down on the other side of the table, I quickly make sure Rasputin's gun is out of reach.</p>
<p>	He struggles to move over onto his back. A gaping bullet wound is clearly evident on his chest, and I can tell he does not have long to live. Using the last of his strength as it quickly escapes him, Rasputin gestures for me to come closer.</p>
<p>	Fearing some last trick, I am wary but approach anyway. In a whisper barely audible, he says to me, "You should have joined me when you had the chance. I am not the only one who hopes to see the fruition of this plan or one similar to it. My superiors will try again in a different way and they have the means to do so."</p>
<p>	My shocked reaction to these words causes Rasputin to sputter a laugh that spreads blood down his chin and across his face. "Yes, I do have superiors," he continues. "I was only a pawn in their game. Others will be back, and they will be more successful than I. You and your country have a hard battle ahead of you. One you are not likely to win."</p>
<p>	As soon as finishes these words, his eyes glaze over and his head flops to the side. Immediately after, the radio squawks and John says, "Mark, did I hit any of the hostages?"</p>
<p>	I respond, "No, it was an amazing shot, thank you."</p>
<p>	John says, "You will be happy to know that our people have begun swarming the building and are clearing out all of Rasputin's men. You should be safe up at the top floor. Also, I just heard that the United States military is on its way to free the city and the remaining members of Congress being held hostage. I guess the free members of Congress were finally able to come to an agreement on how to free their colleagues."</p>
<p>	I breathe a sigh of relief at these words, knowing that Bakersville will finally be safe. The safety of the United States may still be in question from Rasputin's last words, though.</p>
<p>	All the newly freed captives begin hugging one another and clapping me on the back. They all come up and thank me for saving their lives. Paul comes over and shakes my hand in thanks. My mind is in a haze, though, because the only thing I can think about it are Rasputin's final words.</p>
<p>	I thought this would end with Rasputin's death and the release of the members of Congress being held hostage, but this is only the beginning? What other kind of terrible things will they do to seek a rise to power after the takeover of an entire city failed?</p>
<p>	Also, how many members of Congress have been secretly implanted that will still be loyal to these evil men. What will it mean for the behavioral modification chip now that Rasputin and Stefan are dead? Will it still work to turn members of Congress into loyal subjects of Stefan's superiors?</p>
<p>	Sara grabbing me in a huge hug and planting a kiss right on my lips brings me back from my thoughts. A feeling of warmth and comfort spreads through my body as I kiss her back for a moment. When we pull away from each other, she smiles and says, "So, where did you want to go on our date? Don't think I forgot my promise to you in all the excitement! Thank you for saving my life once again."</p>
<p>	Before I can answer, the radio squawks. It is John. The voice on the other side says, "I am so glad this is over and we can return to our regulars lives."</p>
<p>	I reply back, thinking about Rasputin's final words, "I am glad it's over, too. For now."</p>
