<h3> Chapter 22 </h3>
<p>Racking my brain for any question that might delay the needle from my skin, I ask, "You mentioned you developed this technology with a neuroscientist? What happened to him?"</p>
<p>	The question stops the Doctor in his tracks. His hands drop to his sides, and he answers, "I killed him. Once the implant was a reality, I realized that I could not have any competition if my goals were to be achieved. He was vital to the development of the device and how it would work inside the brain, but after we ironed out the kinks, he was no longer needed."</p>
<p>	"I thought after taking him out, I would be in sole control of the device. With it, if utilized properly, I could achieve anything I wanted. The problem was, my former colleague had connections that were unknown to me. He was in communication with some very powerful people who were not very happy to hear about his death."</p>
<p>	"Unfortunately for me, being the only person left alive who knew how to construct the device, I was to become their pawn. They jumped me the day after I put a bullet through my partner's head. A couple of hired mercenaries attacked me, killing my personal bodyguards. After holding me down, they used my own research to plant one of the mind influencing implants in my head."</p>
<p>	"They kept me awake for the entire process. I could feel them making the incision in my skull, which hurt like hell. The worst part of the process, though, is I knew they were digging in my brain, but I could not feel what they were doing. The brain is the only part of the body with no pain receptors."</p>
<p>	"Rasputin arrived seconds later. I had heard of him before. When running around in underground and criminal circles, you tend to hear about many less than savory people. The only thing I knew about Rasputin was he was extremely powerful and well connected."</p>
<p>	"He only spoke two words to me during the critical phase of the implant. This is when the implant reads the brain as a command is spoken, and stores the information. That information is used to regulate the dopamine and serotonin. The two words he spoke were, 'Obey me,' and with their utterance, I was completely in his control."</p>
<p>	"I am actually still loyal to him now, and every time I do his wishes the feeling is euphoric. My own ambitions were slightly derailed, but all I really wanted was the ability to spread my device to influential people to control them. With Rasputin's help, I have gotten what I wanted, just in a round about way. He is in ultimate control, not me, but it doesn't matter if I am in command or second in command if all of my goals are achieved along the way. Besides, the few times I did try to resist his commands, I felt miserable."</p>
<p>	"When Rasputin told me that we would be attacking the United States, I thought he was insane. My own ambitions would only have put me on top of drug cartels, mafia rings, and things of that nature in less developed countries. His dreams were much more lofty."</p>
<p>	"He told me that with my chip implanted in the right Congressmen, we could buy ourselves control of one of the greatest nations in the world. Thanks to the Hyde Bill, which was put forward by members of Congress we have already implanted, we could buy ourselves some time to take over a key city holding a financial summit and implant a large number of the remaining members of Congress."</p>
<p>	"The people of the United States would see the attack as thugs seeking money, but would have no idea what our true plans were. It would not matter if the ransom was paid or if my troops were destroyed as long as Rusputin and I got away. Either way, we would have full control of the country with the majority of congress under our influence."</p>
<p>	"We are using this very factory to make enough implant chips to put into the Congressman before they are supposedly rescued. Rasputin planned out his attack very well."</p>
<p>	"Okay, enough talk. Let's get on with the implantation," Doctor Stefan continues as he raises the needle once more. "I will make a small incision into your skull and place the device next to your brain. Then after I have ensured it is placed properly, I will tell you exactly what I want you to do."</p>
<p>	"You may fight my suggestion for a short amount of time, but eventually you will be only too happy to do my bidding. Let me...," the Doctor's sentence is cut short by a sudden shaking that grips the building. The torture devices clatter on the wall and a few fall to the floor.</p>
<p>	A sudden look of anger crosses the doctor's normally calm and composed face. "Excuse me, I need to go deal with this. I hate these damn rebels and can't wait until they fall in line with the rest of the population. I will have to put off implanting you for a while," the Doctor says through gritted teeth. He storms out, slamming the door behind him.</p>
<p>	Thank God for that explosion. I can not let him implant me, no matter what. I have to figure a way to get out of this.</p>
<p>	I frantically look around the room, trying to find something to help me out of these straps. I strain to pull my arms out, but there is no give. The only part of my body I am able to move is my torso and head. I arch my back and push with all my might to see how tight the leg straps are connected. They do not budge an inch, but as my body falls back to its resting place, the chair seems to move slightly.</p>
<p>	I crane my neck as far as it will go to see what connects the chair to the floor. A metal pole about the size of my leg and four bolts are the only things holding me up. I shake my body while watching the bolts and the metal pole moves the smallest amount, pulling against the bolts.</p>
<p>	Maybe I have a chance of tipping this chair over, but if it does, its going to hurt. Guess me hitting the floor will not be nearly as bad as having a mind control chip implanted in my brain. Here goes.</p>
<p>	I move my hips and chest as far as they can go in one direction and then throw them violently into the opposing direction. The chair moves just a little more than it did before. I repeat the process in the opposite direction, hoping to get some sort of rocking momentum. Each time, the straps dig farther into my wrists and ankles, but I ignore the pain and continue on.</p>
<p>	After the fifth time of shifting my weight as hard as I can on the chair, I hear the sound of straining metal and feel the chair go a little bit farther to the right. I rock slower back to the left, than throw my body even harder to the right, now fueled by the hope of freedom. The chair moves farther to the right than it did last time, and I feel on the verge of tipping over. Gravity pulls me back, and the chair remains upright.</p>
<p>	Having a good feeling this is the last time, I rock to the left and then to the right. The chair reaches the tipping point, and then goes over. I fall toward the carpeted ground. Attempting to fall as gracefully as possible, I try to keep myself from falling too hard into the barely cushioned floor. There is a crunching noise as the chair crashes to the floor.</p>
<p>	The blow against the floor is not overly bad. I manage to hold my head up and avoid letting it strike the floor. My arm and leg take the brunt of the fall. A dull pain courses through them, but luckily, nothing feels broken.</p>
<p>	Seconds after I hit the floor, I notice movement in one of the camera monitors sitting above the doctor's desk. It is a live camera feed of a hallway, and words in the upper right hand corner say, "Manager's Office."</p>
<p>	That is the camera for the hallway right outside this door. Two men are walking down the hallway towards the room. One man I recognize as Doctor Stefan, and the other wears the fatigues of a soldier.</p>
<p>	Damn, what am I going to do? If they find me in this state, they will make sure I am secure enough next time to implant the chip in me. I have to get out of this chair, and fast. With my face pressed against the floor, I look about frantically for something to help me.</p>
<p>	When the building shook during the explosion, I know some of those sharp edged torture devices fell to the floor. I have to get a hold of one to cut these straps off of my wrist and ankles.</p>
<p>	A wicked looking knife with a curved blade and wooden handle, looking like a meat hook with a bladed edge, rests on the carpet only two feet away from my strapped down hand. It is not far away, but it will be nearly impossible to shift the chair that much before the doctor and this guard make it to the room. I can not give up and let them use me. I have to try to get that blade.</p>
<p>	Looking up, I see the two men on the monitor stop outside the door. Stefan places his hand on the door handle. Not knowing what their first reaction will be when they see me lying on the ground, I think fast. Maybe I can say the chair fell by itself, weakened in the explosion. That might buy me some more time.</p>
<p>	My eyes are locked onto the handle of the door, but it remains still. Glancing back at the monitor, I see the two men are engaged in a heated discussion. I am unable to hear what they are saying, but both men are animatedly gesturing with their hands and seem to be shouting about something. The two men do not appear to be arguing with one another, but directing their anger elsewhere. The rebels are probably doing a good job of disrupting their plans. I hope so, anyway.</p>
<p>	Using the borrowed time until the door opens, I focus once again on getting to that knife. Since it is the only thing I can move, I arch my back sideways in the air and then press my torso to the floor in one swift motion. I move a few inches, but the knife still lies more than a foot from my hand.</p>
<p>	Repeating the same action, I squirm my body faster and with as much force as my constraints allow. Inching ever closer, I check the monitor again. The men are still deep in discussion, but they could stop at any time.</p>
<p>	Finally, the tip of my index finger brushes the smooth wooden handle of the blade. I look up at the monitor once more and see the soldier marching away swiftly down the hall. That means the door will open any second now.</p>
<p>	With one final thrust of my body, I am finally able to touch enough of the weapon to flick it towards me, and firmly grasp it in my shackled hand. The next instant, the door clicks open, and I watch through the monitor as the Doctor walks into the room. His face is completely buried in a manilla folder, scanning the documents inside intently.</p>
<p>	I can now see myself and the chair lying on the floor of the room through the open door on the black and white camera screen. Doctor Stefan is so absorbed in the papers he is looking at that he is completely oblivious to his surrounding. He does not notice me or the knocked over chair lying on the carpet.</p>
<p>	He absentmindedly shuts the door, blocking my vision of him through the monitor. Moments later, he moves in front of me and approaches his desk. Without looking at me, Stefan says, "Don't worry, Mark. I will be with you in a second." He takes a seat, sets the manilla folder down, and continues to read.</p>
<p>	I take the knife and reverse it in my hand so the blade points toward my wrist. I slide the sharp edged hook between my skin and the strap holding my arm to the chair. Pushing out as hard as I can with my wrist, the blade slides through the strap easily.</p>
<p>	The edge of this blade must have been incredibly sharp, because it sliced through that strap almost like butter. I do not even want to think about what this was used before it became Doctor Stefan's museum piece.</p>
<p>	With one arm free, I actually begin to feel like I might stand a chance. I swiftly take the knife to my other wrist and slice its strap as well. As soon as both my arms are free, I reach for my legs. The Doctor  finally notices my motion and looks up from his papers.</p>
<p>	"What the hell! How did this happen?" the Doctor exclaims. He jumps up from his desk and runs over to my overturned chair. Before he makes it too close to me, I use the knife to swiftly slice off my leg straps. I fall out of the sideways chair and topple onto the floor.</p>
<p>	Stefan runs back behind his desk after seeing me free, and picks up his phone. I can not let him call for help. I spring from the ground toward the desk. With a look of terror on his face, Stefan jumps out of the way just as I swing the knife toward the receiver of the phone. The keen blade cuts deep into the plastic of the phone and knocks it out of the Doctor's hands.</p>
<p>	Before I can do anything else, the Doctor grabs something out of a drawer.</p>
<p>	"Freeze, don't move!" Stefan yells. He brandishes a silver pistol in his hands. He cocks the weapon, and says, "Put your hands in the air! I will shoot you if you don't let me implant you. Which would you rather be? Implanted, or dead?"</p>
<p>	I hold still with a sinking feeling in my gut. If I give myself up, I will give away any chance I have of avoiding getting a chip implanted in my head. My security detail will be increased, and I am positive I will not be given a chance like this again.</p>
<p>	Sure, I am looking down the barrel of a loaded gun held by the craziest doctor I have ever had the displeasure of meeting, but I refuse to let myself be implanted with a device that will make me want to bow to his every whim. I am going to get out of this room, or die trying.</p>
<p>	I begin to put my arms up slowly. The barrel of the gun glares at me like a cosmic black hole waiting to swallow me up. The thought of the deadly object that will come flying out of it almost unnerves me from my next course of action.</p>
<p>	Halfway through raising my hands into the air, I flick the sharp-edged torture device as hard as I can towards the doctor's outstretched arm. At the same time, I throw myself as far away from the path of the bullet as possible. The gunshot is deafening in the small space of the room, but the bullet misses me entirely as the Doctor attempts to move out of the way of the incoming blade.</p>
<p>	Stefan does not move fast enough, and the weapon grazes his knuckles holding the gun. The knife continues, slicing part of the way up his arm. Blood shows through his cut jacket, and the doctor drops the gun to the floor. Tripping over his own feet, he collapses against the wall to the right of his desk.</p>
<p>	The Doctor hits the wall with the full force of his body weight, and it shakes from the impact. I dive towards the gun as soon as it drops, and I land with my hand on the weapon. Before I can do anything else, I notice the bladed pendulum wobble on the wall directly above the Doctor's head.</p>
<p>	One of the brackets holding the sharp-edged pendulum to the wall suddenly snaps. The free end of the blade swings down, slicing deep into the Doctor's skull. His eyes stare straight at me in disbelief for a few seconds before they roll to the back of his head and glaze over. He does not move again.</p>
<p>	I stand up slowly and brush myself off. I can not believe that just happened. Setting the silver handgun on the desk, I sink into the thick leather armchair that formerly belonged to Doctor Stefan. After a few minutes of rest, I hear a loud knocking at the door. This room must not be completely soundproof. Someone must have heard that shot.</p>
