<h3> Chapter 25 </h3>
<p>I travel down the hallway until I reach the expanse of the shipping area. A pallet of boxes sits a few feet out onto the floor with no one around it. Staying low, I run and position myself behind it so I can remain unseen. I open one of the boxes and find it is full of small green squares that look like computer chips, yet they have nothing one them.</p>
<p>	These must be the blanks that they put the transistors and other parts of the chip on to make the behavioral control devices.</p>
<p>	Taking a handful of the blank chips, I throw them as hard as I can to the opposite corner of the warehouse. The small pieces of plastic clatter loudly against the concrete floor and the metal shelves lining the walls. The soldiers in the loading dock come to instant alert. With their guns raised, all the soldiers in the room run to investigate the noise.</p>
<p>	As soon as my route is clear, I quietly sprint toward the elevator. The doors of the elevator sit wide open from the soldiers using it earlier. Once inside, I press the elevator button and wait for the doors to shut. Come on, hurry up and close.</p>
<p>	After waiting for a few nerve racking seconds, holding my firearm ready in case any of the guards happen to turn around, the doors finally slide closed. All of the soldiers still have their backs turned so none of them notice.</p>
<p>	I slip the key into the slot next to the button marked "Basement" and turn it. The button lights up, and the elevator begins to move down. I breath a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>	Running the elevator earlier when no one was inside should serve to my advantage. The soldiers will be less likely to check the other floors when the elevators runs, since they did not find anything the first time. Hopefully, the soldiers will think the elevator has a malfunction and not bother to investigate.</p>
<p>	The slow freight elevator takes about 30 seconds to reach the basement. The doors slide open, and I find myself staring into a small dimly lit area filled with all sorts of storage shelves and large cylindrical storage tanks. Most of the tanks are marked, "Corrosive," and all have a warning about pressure.</p>
<p>	The largest storage tank stands three times as tall as me and is marked, "Pure Oxygen," "Inflammable," and "Explosive." Sounds perfect.</p>
<p>	I quickly look around and am startled to find a body slumped up against a wall. Blood stains the wall and floor behind him. He is wearing a blue custodian uniform.</p>
<p>	Must have been one of the unlucky workers of this factory that the soldiers did not want to use. I should check and see if he was a smoker. I need to find a way to start a fire.</p>
<p>	I rifle through the man's pockets even though the stench is terrible. Who knows how long this man has been lying here. I am pretty sure he is beginning to decay. Finding a pack of cigarettes in his pockets lets me know I will not have to look much farther. A more thorough search reveals a small black disposable lighter in another pocket.</p>
<p>	Dropping the lighter into one of my own pockets, I move closer to the oxygen tank. A thick hose runs from the bottom to another machine which has a cluster of smaller hoses running out of it. 	This must split the oxygen to supply the numerous separate clean rooms in this building. Once the fire starts down here, it could travel up these hoses and spread to the rest of the facility very quickly as long as Max has turned off the safeguards.</p>
<p>	I run back to the elevator, grabbing a pile of old cardboard boxes on the way. Tossing them on the ground in front of the elevator, I hold the lighter next to the dry cardboard until a nice little bonfire has been started.</p>
<p>	I press the button for the lift to go to the second floor, bypassing the shipping floor. After taking careful aim, I wait for the doors to slide shut. In the split second before the door closes, I squeeze off a shot at the tank filled with the flammable oxygen.</p>
