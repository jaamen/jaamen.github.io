<h3> Chapter 16 </h3>
<p>Sara stares off into the distance as she says, "Alright, well, I was sitting in my calculus class at the university when I felt the first explosion hit."</p>
<p>She turns to look at me, studying my face. "Speaking of the university, I think I've seen you in some of my classes. Your face looked familiar when we first met, but I couldn't place it until now."</p>
<p>	"Yeah, I think we had Intro to Psych together now that you mention it, but that class had around two hundred people in it. Its no wonder we were never properly introduced," I reply. "Keep going."	Actually, I think she is one of the girls I had no courage to approach and start a conversation with before this situation started.</p>
<p>	Sara continues, her voice becoming more excited as she recalls the events, "The explosion rocked the building I sat in, and everyone thought it was an earthquake at first. I know earthquakes are uncommon here, but we expected an explosion even less."</p>
<p>	"As soon as it happened people started getting out of their seats. Some ducked under their desks and others headed for the door. No one really knew what they were supposed to do. The professor in that class was really old and frail, so no one looked to him for help. He was shouting at everyone to stay calm and remain in their seats until someone notified him what to do next. I don't think anyone listened to him."</p>
<p>	"I got up from my seat and headed for the door. If it was an earthquake I didn't want to be in the building if an aftershock hit. I ran into the hallway, and was shocked to see men wearing gear like a SWAT team would wear. They were knocking people down to the ground and tying their hands with large zip ties."</p>
<p>	"One kid wrestled away and started sprinting down the hall. He almost made it to the corner of the hallway and out of sight, but a soldier raised his gun and shot him right in the back. He was running and there was a gunshot. A red patch appeared on his back, then he crumpled and fell. He didn't move again."</p>
<p>	Tears begin to stream down Sara's face as she relays this part of the story, and she takes a moment before continuing. "I had classes with him. We even studied together a few times, and I watched him die. Everyone who ran was either beaten and thrown to the ground, or shot."</p>
<p>	"I couldn't move and just stood there until one of the men walked up to me, zip tied my wrists behind my back and shoved me down onto the ground with my back to the wall. Students were lined up and down the walls, all with their hands fastened behind their backs."</p>
<p>	"The men walked up and down the corridor waving their weapons back and forth as if daring someone to give them a reason to shoot. Some people were crying, and others were in complete shock with blank looks on their faces."</p>
<p>	"I kept thinking: Is this real? When am I going to wake up in my bed and realize this is all a bad dream? But I knew it was no dream. It was real, and I wasn't sure if I was going to live or die."</p>
<p>	"I don't know how long we sat there, but eventually a man in a black suit and tie walked into the hallway. He was wearing sunglasses even though the building was not brightly lit. I think he did not want anyone to see his eyes. He walked up and down the rows of students, sweeping his head back and forth as he surveyed us."</p>
<p>	"One girl was crying hysterically. The man yelled at her to shut up, but this only made her cry harder. He pulled a handgun from his pocket and aimed it right into her face. Everyone in the hall had their eyes on him and winced at the sight of the gun."</p>
<p>	"His finger moved to the trigger, and he asked her one more time to shut her mouth. I closed my eyes not wanting to see this girl die and prepared myself for the shot, but none came. Thankfully, the girl had gone silent as soon as she saw the gun."</p>
<p>	"'That's better, I can actually hear myself think now,' the man said with a smirk on his face. That smirk made me hate and distrust the man immediately. What kind of monster do you have to be to smirk while something like this is happening?"</p>
<p>	"Then he said to us, 'When I say so, I want you all to stand up and walk single file out of the building. There will be a bus waiting right outside that you are all to get on to. If anyone holds up the line, they will be shot. If anyone resists, they will be shot. If you try to leave the line, you will be shot. In other words, if you do anything other than walk in a single file line out to that bus you will be shot.'" 	"Nobody said or did anything to bring any wrath down on themselves, but it came anyway. The man in the suit grabbed a freshman boy by the hair and threw him as hard as he could against the wall for no reason. Then he walked up and kicked the boy in the ribs as he was picking himself up off the ground. 'This is a demonstration to let you know just how serious we are,' he said."</p>
<p>	"The boy was on his hands and knees gasping for air as the man in the suit kicked up into his face. Blood sprayed out of his nose and mouth, and he fell onto his back on the floor. 'Go now, and don't try anything stupid unless you want to end up like him, or better yet, him,' the man said, as he first gestured to the boy bleeding on the ground, and then to one of the people who had been shot."</p>
<p>	"We all walked outside, and sure enough there were rows of school buses sitting in the parking lot. A soldier in body armor was driving each bus, and each one I could see had at least two other soldiers inside with machine guns."</p>
<p>	"No one dared to cause any trouble after the displays of violence they had just witnessed. I wondered when the army or military would be here to save us, and why the rest of the town had not been notified the university was under attack." After looking past the buses and seeing the freeway in the distance littered with destroyed cars, I had my answer."</p>
<p>	"That is when I realized the whole town was under attack, and none of us had any idea how far this thing stretched. For all we knew, the entire United States was under attack and these men were from some other country, like Russia or something."</p>
<p>	"I was toward the front of the line, so I was placed on the first bus in the row. I was instructed to sit in a seat near the middle and another girl was placed beside me. I was next to the window and looked out to see row upon row of students file onto the many buses. When all the students had gotten on, the man in the suit pulled out a radio and said something into it. Then he put it in his pocket and walked toward the front of the line of buses."</p>
<p>	"I had hoped he would not try to ride on our bus because of his earlier violence, but he climbed on my bus anyway. He only glanced back at us long enough to yell, 'NO TALKING AT ALL!' before sitting in one of the front seats."</p>
<p>	"I looked at the girl who was sitting next to me. She looked back at me with huge terrified eyes, that were pleading me not to try and talk to her. She looked so scared I did not do anything to get her into trouble. We rode in complete silence."</p>
<p>	"Out the window, I saw black SUV's as the only cars driving on the road. I even saw a couple of tanks. I remember thinking these soldiers must be well prepared for their assault. The only other objects on the road were destroyed vehicles spewing smoke, surrounded by broken glass."</p>
<p>	"After about ten minutes of our drive a red sports car flew past us. I saw a harried looking man in the front seat. He looked up at the bus quickly before gunning the accelerator and shooting in front of us. Not too long after, two black SUV's flew past our buses in pursuit."</p>
<p>	"The red car didn't make it far in front of us before another SUV came driving the wrong way on the freeway, bearing down quickly on the smaller car. The SUV looked as though it were prepared to ram the smaller car, but the man swerved out of the way at the last second. He lost control of his vehicle and smashed into the concrete barrier of the freeway."</p>
<p>	"The three SUV's drove up to the wreckage, and the soldiers inside hopped out. They began firing their machine guys into the windshield as the bus continued past. Eventually the bullet ridden car was out of sight, but it was one more terrible image I will never be able to erase from my memory. 	"'That's what happens when you try to resist us,' the man in the suit said to the driver of the bus. The driver grunted in agreement, and they both chuckled as we continued down the road. My blood ran hot with hatred for the man in the suit, and the only thing stopping me from outright attacking him was the soldiers with guns protecting him."</p>
<p>	"After driving for about twenty minutes in complete silence, seeing nothing but destruction and desolation out the window, we arrived at the storage facility. No one on the bus knew what we were doing there except for our captors. I thought maybe we were picking up supplies stored in the lockers."</p>
<p>	"The man in the suit ordered all of us to stand to our feet and walk in a calm single file line out of the bus, and then we would receive further instructions. We shuffled out of the bus, following the man in the suit. The soldiers had their weapons trained on us the entire time in case anyone got out of hand, but no one dared to do anything."</p>
<p>	"As soon as we got off, more men in body armor pointed us to the garage-size lockers. We all walked over to them without resistance. The first group, including me, was led to one of the sheds, and we were instructed to go inside."</p>
<p>	"Soldiers standing by some boxes handed us orange jumpsuits and told us to put them on when the doors closed. As soon as they told us this, I knew they were going to lock us inside. We all walked in, and the moment that we were crammed in like sardines they shut the door, sealing us all inside."</p>
<p>	"Immediately some people went to check the door, but it had been modified to prevent anyone from opening it from the inside. The storage locker was well lit and empty except for group of cots and a large blue portable toilet someone had wheeled into the room."</p>
<p>	"The room was just big enough for all of us to be able to move around, but not very comfortably. People began talking to one another, asking each other if anyone knew what was going on, but no one had any idea."</p>
<p>	Cell phones were pulled out almost immediately, but no one had any signal. The group collectively decided that the room itself was shielded from cell phone service or the networks themselves were down. I guessed the networks were down, because if these people had taken over the entire city, it would be to their advantage to take down people's ability to communicate or call out on cell phones."</p>
<p>	"After a few minutes, someone began yelling to be heard over the chatter of voices, 'We need to get these jumpsuits on. They told us to put them on, and if we don't that will probably be reason enough in their minds to shoot us. I suggest we all put them on right now before that door opens again.'"</p>
<p>	"There were murmurs of agreement and a bustle as everyone pulled on the drab orange jumpsuits over their clothes. I heard a man next to me say to someone, 'We look like prisoners in these,' and the man he spoke to replied, 'I think that's the whole idea.' They looked at each other somberly as we all finished putting on our new uniforms."</p>
<p>	"No one really knew what to do next except to wait, so most people found a place to sit. I put my back to an empty patch of wall and sunk to the floor. It felt good to be able to relax a bit after the excitement and shock of what had just happened. I closed my eyes to think and take stock of my situation."</p>
<p>	"I must have dozed off after a while, because the next thing I knew, the garage door of the locker was thrown open. Soldiers with machine guns in black armor were yelling at us to get up and step out of the locker. Outside the sky was awash with red streaks, and it was much darker out than when we had first entered the storage facility."</p>
<p>	"One of the soldiers said to us as we walked out, "At least you lot had the common sense to listen and put on your jumpsuits, some of the others were not so smart. The man gestured with his head to a pile of something under a tarp heaped in the corner of the distant chain link fence that marked the perimeter of the facility. I could only imagine what was under that tarp and tried to block it from my mind."</p>
<p>	"The men pointed for us to walk over to a group of tables with a bunch of paper bags on it. The man in the suit from earlier stood behind the tables. He instructed us to come over and listen up.</p>
<p>	He said, 'Take a paper bag and eat the food inside. If you don't like it, don't eat it, but don't complain either. We don't like complainers. You are allowed to have two hours outside of your locker, in the bounds of the facility. The top of the fence is covered with razor wire and armored trucks are parked at the corners of the fence. Also, you will be monitored by armed guards at all times. Don't be stupid. Your stay here will only last a few days as we prepare for the next phase in our takeover. There is nothing you can do to stop us so don't even try. After your stay here, you will be taken to one of our work camps. There you will help set in motion a way for us to all live together in harmony and we will no longer have the need for all this security, but until then deal with it. You have two hours, and then you need to be back inside your shed.'"</p>
<p>	"After that, he turned around to walk towards what looked to be the office complex of the building, and that is the last time I saw him. Everyone grabbed a bag of food and spread apart. No one seemed to want to try and talk to one another in front of the guards. They hadn't said it was forbidden, but no one wanted to do anything that could possibly make them stand out to the guards."</p>
<p>	"It had been hours since I had eaten, so after I grabbed my bag, I walked around the fence while I ate a ham sandwich. They put us back into the storage unit after about two hours. The first night was pretty bad. Lots of people were still in shock, and everyone felt very hopeless. There were not enough cots for all of us, so many people chose to sleep on the floor. It was hard to sleep on the hard concrete floor so close to everyone else, especially with so many people crying, but I eventually drifted off."</p>
<p>	"I was awoken the next morning to the sun glaring in, blinding me for a bit as the door of the storage unit was opened by the guards. We were let out to eat what I figured was lunch since the sun was nearly overhead. This was our new routine. We would be locked in the unit for hours and then let out for two hours to eat and exercise. This went on for days."</p>
<p>	"After the first couple of days, people began to start talking about escape in our unit. I was of the mindset that we shouldn't try anything stupid enough to give the guards a reason to shoot at us, but a large group of the others didn't agree."</p>
<p>	"There were about fifteen who planned to pull the guards who opened the storage unit door inside and steal their weapons. Then they planned to shoot the other guards before they could react. The day I knew they had decided to try it was the third day we had been at the facility."</p>
<p>	"I got as far back in the unit as I could, knowing it was not going to end well. A few of the others tried to talk them out of it, telling them that help was probably already on its way. The people who were going to try and escape did not listen. They had already decided they were not going to wait around to be rescued; they were going to get themselves out."</p>
<p>	"The door flew open in the morning, sending brilliant white sunlight into the dimly lit unit. It took a few seconds for our eyes to adjust to the glare, and the men planning to escape tried to grab the guards. I don't know if their eyes took too long to adjust or some other reason prevented them from securing the weapons of the guards, but they were not successful."</p>
<p>	"The storage unit was suddenly exploding with sound so loud my ears began to ring. I ducked down as bullets struck the wall above my head, dusting me with pieces broken off of the concrete walls. The fifteen who attempted to make the grab on the guards were the only ones standing up when the door was opened. Everyone else had ducked down in anticipation of the inevitable gunfire."</p>
<p>	"The fifteen people fell to the ground and lay perfectly still. The two guards who had opened the door gestured to some of their comrades, and the bodies were dragged out of the unit while others stood with their guns pointed at us ready to fire if anyone else tried something stupid."</p>
<p>	"After that, it was back into the routine again for another day. The entire time we had been at the storage facility, the guards always seemed to prey on the weaker individuals. I don't know if it made them feel better about themselves or what, but they picked on anyone who was physically weaker, like older people or the younger students."</p>
<p>	"When that guard started beating that boy, I know it was stupid, but I just couldn't take it anymore. I couldn't stand by and watch some bully in body armor beat that kid to a pulp. I was going to get shot for it, maybe even worse, but I decided to take a stand. Luckily it didn't turn out so bad, because you came along, thank God."</p>
<p>	Suddenly she is silent, and the only sound that fills the air is the rain striking the ground all around us. I know she is thinking back on her ordeal, and I try to digest the information as well.</p>
<p>	They struck during the day which is extremely bold and means they have a lot of firepower to back them up. That would have made rounding up people a lot easier, because most people would be out of their houses. They must have an entire army of soldiers with them if they rounded up the entire town. How are we supposed to fight back against an army?</p>
