<h3> Chapter 21 </h3>
<p>Slowly I open my eyes, but all I am able to see is blurred colors swaying back and forth in my vision. I blink a few times to clear my head, and realize it is not just my eyesight moving. My entire body is being carried, and the ground moves beneath me. I begin to see cracks every few feet, and even though my head is still muddled and very confused, I realize I am being carried over a sidewalk.</p>
<p>	I try to move my arms, but find that they are fastened together tight enough I am unable to pull them apart. Vice like hands grab my upper arms, and I feel my legs are suspended over the ground by another pair of hands grabbing my shins. The camouflage soldier's outfit I was previously wearing has been replaced by a solid black jumpsuit.</p>
<p>	Even though it is really hard to think with the splitting headache throbbing in my head, I am aware enough to realize I should avoid letting my captors know I have come back to consciousness. I let my body lay as still as possible, but allow my eyes to rove in an attempt get a bearing on my situation.</p>
<p>	Below me lies the sidewalk with its rough concrete surface, only broken by a straight crack every few feet. To the right of the sidewalk, green grass stretches as far as I am able to see without turning my head. On my left, there is a parking lot filled with cars. I can not see what lies in front of me, and have no idea where I am being carried to with my head hanging limp.</p>
<p>	My sense of sight is limited, but using my ears I can hear a lot of voices talking near me. All of them are coming from the direction of the parking lot. I can not make out what anyone is saying, but it sounds as if something exciting is happening.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, we come to an abrupt halt. I hear one of the men who is carrying me say to someone I am unable to see, "We got him. This is Mark, the one who the Doctor and Rasputin have been so interested in. He has an appointment with the Doctor."</p>
<p>	At this last statement, a little chuckle escapes his mouth, and the men standing around my elevated body also let out a few nervous laughs.</p>
<p>	The Doctor. That is who they are taking me to see? Those other soldiers said the only thing they hear coming from his office are screams. I break into a cold sweat, and a million thoughts of everything horrible run through me head as I try to imagine what awaits me.</p>
<p>	"Alright, just follow the signs to the manager's office, and listen for the occasional scream if you get lost," another voice says jokingly a few feet in front of me. Next, I hear three metallic sounding clangs as if someone is banging on something metal. A few seconds later, the rattle of a garage door fills the air, and I realize I am about to enter the factory.</p>
<p>	After the garage door closes behind us, I once again feel forward motion. Watching the ground move past underneath me, the rough concrete turns to smooth cement as we cross the threshold into the building. Being inside a factory, I expect to hear the sounds of machines, but the place is almost completely silent.</p>
<p>	The footsteps of the soldiers holding me echo, so I can tell we are in some sort of cavernous space. What are they doing in here? My curiosity almost makes me raise my head and take a look around, but I remember it will be to my advantage to not let them know I am awake.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, a muffled scream fills the space in the building, and the sound reverberates off the walls. The scream sounds extremely pained as if it escaped from an individual in extreme agony. It also sounds as if the scream came from the other side of a sealed door. That must have come from the Doctor's office. The noise makes my heart grow cold and new thoughts of what await me fill my head.</p>
<p>	"Oh, sounds like the Doctor is working with another patient," one of the soldiers comments in reference to the scream. The others laugh, and a different one than the first says, "Ya, I wouldn't want to be in this guys shoes."</p>
<p>	A few minutes later we stop once more, and I hear three raps that must be knocks on a wooden door. Not long after, there is a click as the door opens, and we once again begin to move. The ground beneath me shifts from concrete floor to plush red carpeting. After only being moved a few feet into the room, I am flipped right side up.</p>
<p>	Closing my eyes so I do not to give away my return to consciousness, I am unable to see what I am dropped upon. It feels like some sort of reclining chair and has a slight amount of cushion. The hands grasping my arms and legs release, but straps quickly replace them.</p>
<p>	The straps are not overly tight, but I know I will not be able to move around much with them on. The desire to open my eyes and my curiosity at the room I am in grows stronger with every second, but I keep my eyelids closed for the time being.</p>
<p>	A voice different from all those belonging to the soldiers previously carrying me says, "Thank you for bringing him to me, now please leave. I have work to do." The voice is authoritative and strong. Next I hear shuffling like footsteps on carpet and then the sound of the door clicking shut. I think I might be alone with a sadistic doctor.</p>
<p>	The urge to open my eyes and look around is nearly overwhelmingly strong. I want to know what this room holds in store for me, but I will let him make the first move. Maybe he will be dumb enough to leave me alone, and I can figure a way out of this.</p>
<p>	I lie in wait for something to happen, and suddenly an intense pain shoots across my face. The shock and surprise of being slapped is too much, and I gasp out in pain, giving away that I am awake.</p>
<p>	"Ah, I see you are awake now," a man says as my eyes come into focus on him. He is wearing a tweed jacket with leather patches on the elbows and a pair of black slacks. A black goatee points down from his chain and circular wire rimmed glasses rest on his nose.</p>
<p>	He reminds me of a picture of Sigmund Freud I saw in a college textbook once. I almost chuckle at his comical appearance but then remember the situation I am in. The laugh dies as a choke in my dry throat.</p>
<p>	"Welcome to my office. My name is Doctor Stefan," the man says in a sickeningly pleasant voice. "I have heard a lot about you. Some of the soldiers say you are a military agent or spy, but I think you have just been lucky to escape us a few times."</p>
<p>	I say in the firmest tone I can muster, so as not to let the fear I am feeling seep into my voice, "I have heard about you as well; how you do sick things to people in here."</p>
<p>	"Oh, come now, I am not really as bad as I seem," the doctor replies in a sweet voice that grates on my nerves.</p>
<p>	He continues, "It is a real pleasure to finally meet you face to face. I know a lot about you, Mark. After you escaped from us multiple times, I started to do some research on you, to find out if you really did have military training. I found out that you are just an introverted college boy, who has some antisocial and agoraphobic tendencies. People I asked about you said you don't like to get out much and are quite shy."</p>
<p>	I stare back at him in fear and disgust, but his analysis of me is fairly close to spot on. Before a  few days ago when the invasion started, I was too nervous to talk to most people, and I rarely went out.</p>
<p>	He is right, and we both know it. Now an amount of shame has been added to my feelings of fear and anger. I do not say a word, but kick my brain into high gear, trying to channel my feelings into something useful. Maybe I can figure a way to get out of this chair. I try to move my arms or legs, but they are strapped down firm and do not budge.</p>
<p>	"Please, don't exert yourself by struggling. The straps are secure, but once I have said my piece and explained my position to you, I am sure you will agree with it," Doctor Stefano says.</p>
<p>	"I will never agree with the things you and your people have done. You can torture me all you like, but I will not agree with you. I could never agree with someone who condones the murder of innocent people," I say back defiantly.</p>
<p>	"Ah, speaking of torture, I first want to show off my collection to you." He waves his hand in a sweeping motion across the room. For the first time I take my eyes off the doctor and get a good look around the room I am in. The walls are wood panel from floor to ceiling and the carpet is a dark red.</p>
<p>	I wonder if the room looked like this before or if these things were brought here more recently. I can not imagine the manager of a factory having an office that looks like this. This sick man's inflated ego probably took man power away from the takeover just to redecorate this room.</p>
<p>	The chair I am strapped to is dead center in the middle of the room and reminds me of a dentist's chair. A large desk sits a few feet in front of me facing the door. The wall behind the desk is lined with bookshelves, and row upon row of books on all academic topics, most of them pertaining to psychology, fill the shelves.</p>
<p>	Multiple closed circuit camera monitors sit next to the books and show grainy images of the factory. A few of them show people moving about, but I am not close enough to get a good look at what they are doing.</p>
<p>	The other three walls in the room are the ones that really catch my attention, though. Various sinister looking torture devices adorn nearly every square inch of the wood panels. Wooden objects with chains hanging from them sit next to metal objects with sharp edges. Devices of many differing shapes and sizes fill the wall, but all of them look as though they could be used to inflict pain.</p>
<p>	Half of the metal objects look extremely old, made of cast iron with years of wear showing on them. The other half are made of stainless steel and spotlessly gleam in the bright light filling the room. It does not take too much imagination to think about how they could be used.</p>
<p>	I begin to breathe deeper as the fear I feel begins to become palpable. I wonder which ones he will use on me, and if I will be able to handle the pain. Maybe he will understand that I do not know anything about the resistance and kill me swiftly.</p>
<p>	"Do you like my collection?," the Doctor asks me, and not waiting for me to answer he continues, "I have had an interest in instruments of torture since I was a teenager. I watched a documentary on television once that sparked my desire to collect. It described different devices and how they were used to inflict pain on an individual."</p>
<p>	"The thing that fascinated me the most, though, and eventually led me to become a psychiatrist, was how the infliction of pain could be used to change a person's behavior. An individual who holds a secret or hates an ideal can be swayed to reveal that secret or be used by the people representing the hated ideal, through torture and pain. If someone has something to hide, they might not tell their best friend, but will tell all they know to a hated enemy after so much pain has been applied."</p>
<p>	The more Dr. Stefan talks, the more uneasy I become, but being strapped to a chair, there is nothing I can do but listen. He continues, "One of my favorite objects, which was very hard to find, is this bladed pendulum."</p>
<p>	Stefan walks over to a huge half-moon shaped blade taking up a good portion of the wall display space. Admiring it with his back turned to me, he says, "This five foot long blade would swing over the victim, getting lower by the second. Eventually, the person could be sliced in half, but each cut only went deeper by a half of an inch."</p>
<p>	"First, the person lying on the table would have to watch their doom come closer and closer, and they might spill all their secrets just to avoid the razor sharp edge. Others might tell all on the first few cuts. Even if all a person's secrets had been revealed, I heard reports that people would continue to slice through a victim just to see the effect. It must have been excruciating for the victim, but fascinating for the one applying the torture."</p>
<p>	"Even more fascinating though, are those who do not give up their secret, but hold the secret with them until death," the Doctor says, becoming more and more excited. He turns from the blade on the wall to me, holding his hands together behind his back.</p>
<p>	"The biggest problem with using torture and pain to get what you want, though, is that the person being tortured does not accept your ideas as their own. The only way to get them to reveal secrets or aid your cause is to subject them to pain and misery, and that person will never agree with you, and only come to hate you more."</p>
<p>	Sounding extremely proud of himself now, Stefan continues, "In a stroke of genius, I came up with an idea. If pain can be used to change a person's behavior, but they hate you for it, maybe pleasure could be used to change a person's behavior as well, and they would love you for it."</p>
<p>	"About ten years ago, I was working with a neuroscientist to create a torture device that could be imbedded in the brain. This device would release chemicals affecting the body's pain receptors, and every time the subject did something I didn't want them to do, that person could be made to feel agony until they once again did my bidding. We had set it up so the device would be run by remote control, which unfortunately meant that the implanter always had to be in sight of the implanted individual."</p>
<p>	"The early trials we ran in a few third-world countries were a disaster. Our technology was still in the early stages and many died because the devices did not install properly. The ones that did implant were not as successful as we had hoped. The subjects who received the chip developed a state of learned helplessness. It has been proven in the lab that if rats are shocked at random intervals and for apparently no reason, eventually the rat will just lay down and take the pain. They give up trying to change their behavior to avoid the shocks, because seemingly nothing is causing them to be shocked."</p>
<p>	"We theorized our technology used in a human brain would overcome this, because a human brain is much more advanced than the brain of a rat. We were sadly mistaken. When people were subjected to pain from the chip, they did not figure out that it was because of a certain action we wanted them to stop doing. With seemingly no outside stimuli causing the pain, the people with the implant would eventually act the same way as the mice. The technology was decided a failure, because there are much cheaper ways to produce the same result as a pain inducing brain chip."</p>
<p>	"I was in a tremendous amount of debt, but I wasn't going to give up so easily. After pain didn't work, I came up with the brilliant idea to go in the complete opposite direction. I would use pleasure and feelings of euphoria when people with the implant did something the implanter wanted. Individuals who understand how the brain works have long known about two chemicals that have a heavy influence on feelings of well-being and pleasure. These two chemicals are serotonin and dopamine."</p>
<p>	"During sexual intercourse, these two chemicals are released in the brain, and that's why people like to engage in this activity so much. When people use drugs like cocaine and heroin, dopamine and serotonin levels are altered in the brain, and this is why these drugs have such addictive effects. When people stop using these drugs, their levels of serotonin and dopamine drop below the normal level. Low levels of these chemicals cause the person to feel withdrawal symptoms, sometimes with dangerous results."</p>
<p>	"This is a simplified explanation of course. It is actually somewhat more complex, but I want to frame these concepts in a way someone as yourself will understand. We do not have time for me to go into too much depth, but I will do my best to make it clear to you. I see from your transcripts that you took Intro to Psychology?"</p>
<p>	He waits for me to respond, so I nod in the affirmative. We did talk about some of the stuff he is explaining in my Psychology class. Learned helplessness was a concept we discussed, as well as dopamine and serotonin. As crazy as this guy sounds, the concepts he is explaining have at least some scientific basis.</p>
<p>	Stefan continues, "Good, then you have some background for this information. Building off of what we knew about dopamine, serotonin, and other brain chemicals we changed our device to control the levels of these in the brain on the whim of the controller."</p>
<p>	"We did away with the remote control, because we knew if this was going to be successful, we would have to come up with another way to control the device. We needed control of the individual even when the implanted subjects were out of our sight. The answer was what I like to call taking a snapshot of the brain. Just as a photo is taken in a certain moment in time, and captures that moment, I developed a way for the implant device to capture the brain waves during a certain thought."</p>
<p>	"That moment occurs when the person implanting the device explains what they want the implanted individual to do. As the person hears their instructions, the device measures the electrical, magnetic, and any other signals emitted by the brain and stores this information. Then, whenever those exact brain wave patterns are reproduced, the implant device releases the feel-good chemicals."</p>
<p>	"Most likely the subject hates the idea originally, but after being exposed to elevated levels of dopamine and serotonin whenever they think of the idea, eventually leads them to fall in love it. The idea tends to work better when it is very simple. Something like "Obey Doctor Stefano" actually works fairly well."</p>
<p>	"If the person decides they want to obey me, then they will get a rush of feel good emotions. If they decide not to, chemicals that inhibit the reception of dopamine and serotonin are released. With the absence of these chemicals in the brain, the person will fall into depression, until they decide to do what I wish. So, in essence, I developed a working system for behavioral modification, or as you might call it, mind control."</p>
<p>	"You have got to be kidding me," I say in disbelief after he relays his story. I was planning on staying quiet until he had said his piece, but this information was much too shocking. The worst part about it, though, is that it makes sense. The soldiers were talking about how people come into this office and leave completely changed and ready to die for the cause. There is no way that torture could lead to something like that.</p>
<p>	"Interestingly, I am not the first person to create a device that could alter the mind. The CIA and a man named Donald Cameron pioneered the science in the early 1950's with their Project MKULTRA. They sought to be able to engineer certain behaviors in humans. The project used many different methods to alter an individuals behavior, such as electroconvulsive shock, drugs like LSD, and even torture."</p>
<p>	"One of the things they would do is repeat a phrase over and over again until the person became obsessed with it. This is a simplified version of my brain snap shot. The project met with mixed results. Many of the people who were subjected to the project ended up with long-term damage. Some even became comatose for the rest of their lives."</p>
<p>	"The project was stopped after it came to light that so many illegal activities were being done on citizens of the United States. I studied their successes and failures to make my own version of behavioral modification much more reliable and safe." </p>
<p>	I block out most of what Doctor Stefan is saying as psychotic rambling, but some of what he has said has lit a spark of hope and also one of great terror inside me. At least I do not think I am going to be tortured, but I will end up being enslaved to this man if he plants one of those devices in me.</p>
<p>	My curiosity is piqued, and even though the situation is grim, I have to know more. I ask, "So you don't torture people in here? What's with the torture device collection? Also, what was that screaming I heard while being brought here?" I say, trying to stall the Doctor from taking any action against me while I try to think of a way out of the chair.</p>
<p>	"Oh, the collection is just for my own personal enjoyment," the Doctor replies. "Over the years, I found pieces to add to it and am quite proud to have such an impressive collection. Having them in the room does wonders for the mindset of the people who work under me, though. Think about it. The soldiers who brought you in here see these and tell their comrades about it. You can believe me that disobedience from my underlings is not a problem."</p>
<p>	"As for the screams, that is just another psychological trick I utilize to keep the fear alive in my soldiers. A hidden loud speaker above the outside of my door plays pre-recorded screams I downloaded off the internet. Never playing the same one twice at the right intervals is very effective. My office is actually very soundproof, so I am not bothered by the workings of the factory. I find that fear of torture can be a much more powerful motivator than torture itself."</p>
<p>	Puzzled, I ask, "But why do you need to scare your soldiers if you can just implant a chip in them and have almost complete loyalty?"</p>
<p>	Doctor Stefan answers, "Yes, unfortunately there are a few drawbacks to the mind control chip. It is quite expensive and time consuming to make. Only those who already have power over others will get the chip. People like congressmen, high ranking military personnel, and corporate chairman will be implanted."</p>
<p>	"We would never have the resources, even with the takeover of this city, to give lowly soldiers or other unimportant individuals the mind control device. As for those who do not get the device, the power of authority and the promise of wealth keep them in line well enough."</p>
<p>	"Quite a few years back now, before these ridiculous review boards got in the way, saying experiments that cause psychological harm can not be performed on humans, a few researchers made some ground breaking finds on the effect an authority figure can have on an individual."</p>
<p>	"One of these experiments asked participants to give electrical shocks to a person who gave wrong answers on a quiz. They could hear, but not see the person they were supposedly shocking. In reality, no one was really being shocked, but the participant was convinced otherwise. An authority figure in the room told the participant it was okay to shock the other person."</p>
<p>	"The researchers of this experiment found that most participants would shock the person if the authority figure said it was okay. Some even continued when the person the participant believed they were shocking begged for them to stop. Very few participants would stop their involvement in the experiment, even though they were told ahead of time they would be able to do so with no consequence."</p>
<p>	"Many of the soldiers involved in this takeover were picked up from different countries around the world. To get loyalty from all of them, authority figures important to a group of soldiers were implanted with the chip. After I told their commanding officers what to do, they passed it on to their soldiers. In a round about way, the soldiers gave me complete loyalty with few spent resources, even when the orders involved immense brutality."</p>
<p>	"Brutality is necessary in this takeover. My superior, Rasputin, told me so. I knew this would not be a problem thanks to another study done before the days of the review boards. Some students at a college were assigned to be guards and others were assigned to be prisoners in a mock prison experiment. The experiment eventually had to be stopped, because the students began taking their roles so seriously that those appointed as guards began to beat the students appointed as prisoners."</p>
<p>	"The students instructed to be guards thought it was okay to mistreat the other students because they were told it was okay. If students will be brutal to fellow students, it will not be hard to get mercenaries and hired soldiers to do the same thing to innocent people."</p>
<p>	"It is very unfortunate that experiments like this can no longer be done, because they might cause psychological harm or undue stress to an individual. I personally think that we would have a much better understanding of the brain if people didn't care so much about the participants in their experiments. Who cares if a few people are stressed or feel sad that they participated in an experiment where they had to make a choice. Those people should just make choices they can live with and stop complaining!"</p>
<p>	"Sorry, I got a little carried away there. Before the initial takeover of the city, I had planted an early version of the device into a commanding officer of a small nation's army I encountered during my trials of the device. Then I carried out my own version of an experiment, and was not restricted by worthless review boards, to figure out which soldiers would give me complete loyalty."</p>
<p>	"Each soldier under this officer's command was instructed to go into the firing range. Once there, they were given a pistol with one bullet. Using the implant device, I had their commanding officer instruct the soldiers to shoot a live person who was tied to a pole in the firing range. The officer would give no reason why, just told the soldier to do it. If the soldier took the shot, he was congratulated and accepted into the cause. This would let me know that soldier is completely loyal to his commanding officer who, thanks to the implant, is loyal to me."</p>
<p>	"Oh, it was such an interesting psychological experiment, though. Some soldiers did their bidding with no questions asked, these were marked as super loyal and given the highest ranking positions in the new army. Others would ask a few questions first, like "Why does this person deserve to die?"</p>
<p>	"The officers only reply was to tell them that they did deserve it, and ask them to do it again. Only a few flat out refused to kill the victim. A few more of these listened when a gun was placed to their own heads, but even then some said they could not shoot an innocent person. Those that were unable to follow the command were kicked out of the group and left to fend for themselves." 	"Anyway, most people will follow the authority of a figure they put at least a small amount of trust in. We gave those that chose to join us, and most of them did, weapons and called them soldiers in our army. They fell into their roles almost right away."</p>
<p>	"Now we are waiting for this facility to become fully operational. Once it does, we will put a chip in the heads of any one who has authority over others, and the people they command will fall right in line with my bidding."</p>
<p>	Shocked and disgusted at what I am hearing, my mouth hangs open in disbelief. I hope this is not true, but everything he is telling me sounds legitimate. We learned about those studies he mentioned in my Intro to Psych class. The only crazy and unbelievable part about his story is that someone would actually want to put a plan such as this into action.</p>
<p> "Wait, you said Congressmen and people with authority will be implanted with the device. The financial summit has brought over a hundred Congressmen to this city. You are not just holding them for ransom, are you?" I say to Stefan as I realize the implications.</p>
<p> Stefan nods his head and says, "You are more clever than I would have given you credit for. Yes, the ransom is just a cover-up so we can implant a large number of Congressman. When my people and my behavioral modification chip can influence the behavior of the United States government, then you will see the true realizations of our goals."</p>
<p>	Even though I am amazed and deathly afraid of what this could mean for my country, my thoughts begin to come back to my own fate, and I ask him, "So what happens to me, and why are you telling me all this?"</p>
<p>	Dr. Stefan just smiles and says, "Well, I told you all this for two reasons. The first reason is one of my own faults. I will be the first to admit that I have an overly large ego and slight delusions of grandeur. If I were diagnosing myself, which all psychology students do as they learn more about the science of the mind, these are things I would attribute to my own psychological profile."</p>
<p>	"I told all this to you, because I feel the need to talk about my art, and share it with someone who will appreciate it. The soldiers who follow me blindly, or the ones with the implant agree with everything I am saying, but that is because they are forced to. Someone like you can appreciate it more, because you have the fear of one who is about to experience it."</p>
<p>	"The other reason I am telling you all this is it makes the implantation process easier. Once people are told of the mind-control chip and how it works, they usually resign themselves to their fate. The things implanted individuals do that are in line with the programmer's wishes make them feel good, so why not do them?"</p>
<p>	"The implanted individual also gets this feeling that his or her actions are not really their own, because they are being controlled by someone else. The subject lets the implanter take the blame for actions not in line with their own beliefs. They project the blame of wrongdoing from themselves to the programmer, because the programmer is the one in control, right?" Stefan says with a slight chuckle.</p>
<p>	There is no way I can let him plant that chip in me. I want to maintain control of my own actions. Attempting to stall as much as possible and hoping to figure a way out of getting implanted, I ask, "So, why am I going to get the device? I don't have any military training or really any special skills. Also, I am not an authority figure to anyone."</p>
<p>	The Doctor looks at me and says, "That is where you are wrong. You do have a special skill. You are a symbol of hope for the rebellion. You might not even know it, but word got around the soldiers, and eventually those that were fighting against us, that someone was out there we just couldn't catch. Even though it has only been a few days, word spread like wildfire."</p>
<p>	"So, maybe you did get lucky and manage to escape us a few times. Well, those who heard about your escapades blew the real story quite out of proportion. The people fighting back at us look at you as a ray of hope, but after you become a lackey for us, you can imagine how that will devastate our opposition. Their morale will be crushed, and we will easily take them out."</p>
<p>	No, I can not let him implant me. People standing up to these monsters need all the hope they can get, so they can stop this madman. I will not let myself become a reason for them to stop fighting. I have to get out of this chair.</p>
<p>	Walking over to his desk, the Doctor says, "Okay, let me prepare the device. The procedure is actually very simple, and I will even be kind enough to give you a sedative.. You won't feel a thing." He opens a drawer in the desk and pulls out a syringe. He pushes the plunger on the syringe and a small amount of liquid sprays out of the end.</p>
<p>	Doctor Stefan walks towards me with the syringe and places his hand on my arm. I try to pull away, but the straps holding me to the chair are much too strong. He prepares to stick me with the needle. Once he injects me with the sedative, there will be nothing I can do to stop him from implanting the device in my head. After that, my actions will no longer be in my own control.</p>
