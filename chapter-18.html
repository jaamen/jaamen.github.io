<h3> Chapter 18 </h3>
<p>Not long after I enter the place of shelter, I hear the sound of men wearing heavy gear trouncing through the woods. They are coming ever closer, and it seems they are trying to go as quietly as they can, but are having a hard time of it. There is no way they can keep all their gear quiet, and it is easy to track their route because they are the only sound in the immense quiet of the woods.</p>
<p>	I hear them approach and walk on either side of my hiding spot. Their heavy boots snap twigs underneath them as they walk only a few feet away. I lay perfectly still, not daring to breathe until they walk farther into the distance. Luckily, they do not search closer around the fallen tree, and the sound of their footsteps and gear fades into the distance.</p>
<p>	I might as well stay here for a while and recover. My whole body is sore, and some time to rest will probably help. Besides, there is no way I am moving from this spot until I am sure those soldiers are gone. I know they are not trying to kill me outright, but torture is probably in store for me if I am caught.</p>
<p>	I doze off for a bit, but wake up to the sound of voices.  Two of the soldiers have walked back, and are having a conversation very near to my place of refuge.</p>
<p>	The short nap left me feeling at least a little refreshed, and I might have enough energy to keep going for a while.</p>
<p>	"I don't know where he could have gotten to," one of the soldiers says.</p>
<p>	Another replies, "He couldn't have come out on the other side of the forest. We had a few guys over there watching the entire tree line, and they would have spotted him."</p>
<p>	The first voice says, "These woods are fairly large, but they are surrounded on all sides by open areas that we had covered from the moment of attack."</p>
<p>	The second voice says, "He could have slipped by them, I don't know if you have heard what they are saying about this guy. He's good, and managed to slip away from us when we thought we had him pinned down before."</p>
<p>	The first voice responds, "I had heard some rumors about him from the other guys. No one really knows that much about him, but they think he had some kind of military training from somewhere. His civilian I.D. was probably a decoy. Who knows what agency he works for, and because he was undercover, we didn't get to him before the takeover."</p>
<p>	With a hint of frustration in his voice, the second voice says, "Well, I could have sworn we were going to catch him in that construction site, but he jumped off the side of a freaking four story building. Who does that and lives to run away? Too bad that drone we secured from the military base had to assist against the rebel attacks. If this Mark guy is hiding in these woods, the drone's infrared cameras would find him in no time."</p>
<p>	Are they really talking about me? I am no soldier and have definitely had no military training. I have been very fortunate to get out of a few sticky situations, ones where I probably should have been killed, but I did not know this had made me known among these soldiers.</p>
<p>	The first voice says, "Ya, but we don't have a drone for now, and it's our skins back at HQ if we come back empty handed. I hear this guy is wanted by the very top."</p>
<p>	The second voice gasps slightly and then says, "You mean he caught the attention of Rasputin and Dr. Stefan?" There is real terror in the man's voice when he speaks the two names.</p> 
<p>	Sounding slightly impressed to shock his friend, the first voice says, "Ya, and he wants him bad. We are not leaving this area until we find him. I am not going back to face who knows what at the hands of someone like Rasputin or the Doctor."</p>
<p>	The first voice responds, "I almost pity this guy if we catch him. I know he has taken some of us out, but I know what the Doctor will do to him if he finds him."</p>
<p>	The second voice says, "Ya, I hope I never have to meet the Doctor face to face. They say he uses methods to manipulate people, and he can make them do whatever he wants them to do. At the factory, I would hear screams coming from his office while on patrol in there. We were told never to open his door no matter what we heard. I am really glad they assigned me to this detail, I don't know how much longer I could stand listening to those screams. I don't know what goes on in his office, and I hope I never find out."</p>
<p>	My mind starts racing as the men walk away from each other to once again search the forest. So I am a high priority target? I can not believe they think I am a soldier. I am really nothing more than a kid going through college, but if they catch me they will torture me to death looking for information that I do not have.</p>
<p>	That is the second time I have heard those names. Dr. Stefan and Rasputin? One of the patrols I met earlier mentioned them as well. Maybe they are the orchestrators of this attack.</p>
<p>	If that drone was here, I would be in their custody already. I am sure a quick aerial thermal scan would show them exactly where I am. At least I know for sure there are other groups of rebels fighting back now. I have to get out of here somehow before they recall that drone or get another one over here to find me, but how? This forest is crawling with soldiers trying to hunt me down.</p>
<p>	I grip the rifle closer to my chest. The steel of the weapon feels cold in my hands as I weigh my options. I am not going to let myself get captured, because it will certainly lead to a lot of pain and my death. I have to get out of this forest so I can find the other pockets of resistance and join up with them. </p>
<p>	My thoughts are interrupted by the sound of a soldier's footsteps coming closer. Through the pile of branches in front of my face, I can just barely make out the top of his black boots and the bottom of his camouflage pants.</p>
<p>	The soldier is walking slowly and deliberately headed straight for my hiding spot under the tree. He nears until his boot is only inches from my face. He is going to check under the tree. Sweat breaks out on my forehead, and I prepare myself to take this man's life with my rifle.</p>
<p>	I am ready to pull the trigger and have my gun aimed at the place where I think his head will appear, when the boots turn around and lift a few inches off the ground. He is sitting on top of my hiding spot, probably taking a load off after walking through the forest with all that gear.</p>
<p>	A silent sigh of relief escapes my body, and I relax a little. Part of me still remains alert in case he changes his mind and checks under the tree. I can hear the man breathing, and he seems to have exerted himself searching for me, because his breaths are coming out hard.</p>
<p>	The soldier's boots are all I am able to see of his body as they swing down from above. One of the boots has a sheath attached, which holds a knife that looks to be about six inches long. If I fire this rifle, the other soldiers will hear for sure and come running. If I can get a hold of that knife without being noticed, I might be able to dispatch this guy without a sound.</p>
<p>	As slowly as I can, I stretch my hand through the branches that are creating the wall of my hiding spot. If he hears me or sees a branch move, I will be discovered. My hand nears the knife. Sweat drips off of my face onto the dirt floor of the forest.</p>
<p>	There is a catch holding the knife in place, and my fingers close around the button. I do not think I can pop this button without him noticing. I am going to grab the knife and take him down all at once. Hopefully the element of surprise will catch him off guard enough for me to survive.</p>
<p>	In one swift motion, I unsnap the button and pull the knife out of the sheath. The man gasps in surprise as the tree he was just sitting on suddenly comes alive underneath him. I stab the knife into the man's foot and reach as high as I can on his body and pull him to the ground.</p>
<p>	He is too shocked to yell out. I smash out of the branches leaving my rifle behind and jump on top of the floored soldier. I pull the knife out of his foot dripping blood, and bring it up to his neck.</p>
<p>	I stop the blade as soon as it rests against the soldier's skin, so he is able to feel the razor sharp edge. His eyes are wide with fear, and I place the index finger of my free hand against my lip to signal him to be quiet. He complies, and thankfully I do not have to kill him.</p>
<p>	He is dressed in full military garb, and his rifle rests against the tree a few feet away. The attack happened so fast, he did not have any time to react or even to cry out. There is a patch that says Ramos on his camouflage jacket.</p>
<p>	"Be quiet, and I will not slit your throat," I whisper to the soldier, trying to put enough malice in my voice to let him know I am serious. "Do you know if any of the other soldiers will be coming to this spot in the next few minutes?" The man shakes his head. Good, I will not be bothered.</p>
<p>	"Here is what I need you do," I say. "Take off your jacket, pants, and boots. I am going to be sitting with my rifle aimed at you. If you try anything funny, I will not hesitate to put a bullet through your head."</p>
<p>	With the knife still at the man's throat, I reach under the tree and grab my rifle. I pull it over and step a yard away from the soldier, pointing the barrel directly at him. He takes off his jacket first and is wearing an olive green shirt underneath. Then he takes off his pants, and the boots are last.</p>
<p>	The half-naked soldier throws the gear toward me. I spy a pair of handcuffs on the man's discarded belt, and I order him to turn around. I snap one end of handcuffs onto one of his wrists and wrap the chain around a thick tree trunk before snapping the other end on his other wrist.</p>
<p>	He probably thinks I am going to kill him now. Instead, I use the knife to cut the sleeves off of his shirt. I stuff one sleeve in his mouth, and I use the other to tie a strip around his head so he is unable to spit out the gag.</p>
<p>	After checking again to make sure he is secured to the tree, I throw a pile of branches on top of him so he is at least somewhat hidden. I could not bring myself to kill this man. I know he would not have turned me the same kindness had our roles been reversed, but the few deaths I have been responsible for in the last couple of days are already haunting me.</p>
<p>	Most of these men are probably just soldiers following orders. The ones really responsible are the people giving those orders.</p>
<p>	I put on the gear I just acquired from the soldier, and hope the disguise will work long enough for me to get out of the woods. I notice a back pack the man had removed before he sat down sitting in a pile of dead leaves. On top of the pack is a helmet, complete with a pair of thick goggles.</p>
<p>	I put the helmet on, take the man's rifle, and secure the goggles onto my face. My disguise is complete, and I pray that it will fool any soldier hunting me. I throw my old rifle into a pile of bushes, and walk off into the forest.</p>
