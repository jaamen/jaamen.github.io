<h3> Chapter 23 </h3>
<p>The knocking at the door reminds me that even though the Doctor is dead, I am still in trouble. The room is a ghastly mess and a large pool of blood is forming around Stefan. I check the monitor behind me to see who is knocking. Two soldiers stand in the hallway with assault rifles in their hands.</p>
<p>	One of the men looks up at the camera, obviously knowing of its existence, and says something. I am unable to hear anything he says, until I realize that all the cameras are on mute to block out the sound. I push a red button next to the camera, and hear the soldier saying, "...everything okay in there? We thought we heard a gunshot." I hear his tinny voice from a small speaker next to the monitor.</p>
<p>	I remain still, but grasp the handgun tighter in my hand in case they decide to investigate further. After a few moments, the two men begin to fidget at the silence.</p>
<p>	One of the soldiers says, "He is probably fine, but does not want to be disturbed. There is no way I am going through that door to check, though. If he is fine and we barge in on him, he might try out one of those torture devices he has on the wall on us."</p>
<p>	The other one looks at him and nods his head in agreement. "We will check back in an hour." They walk away down the hall.</p>
<p>	I breathe a sigh of relief and slump back down into the chair again. I will have to move eventually. The longer I wait, the more suspicious the soldiers will become. I need to move soon, to keep the element of surprise. After a few more seconds of collecting my thoughts and psyching myself up for what I have to do next, I rise to my feet. On my way out of the room, I pick up the curved blade I had thrown at the doctor. Maybe it will come in handy later.</p>
<p>	Silently, I open the door and step into the hallway after checking that all is clear. I close the door behind me. It should be a while before anyone works up the courage to open that door. Once they do, they will know I am running free.</p>
<p>	I have to try and stop them from making the mind implant chips before they find the Doctor's body. As I walk down the hall, a battle begins to wage itself in my head. Am I willing to kill the soldiers guarding this facility if it will help to stop them from taking over the country?</p>
<p>	I turn the corner at the end of a length of the hallway and find myself staring at the back of a soldier. He is leaning up against the green and white wall of the hallway, staring off into space. Beyond him, I can see piles of cardboard boxes in a large open space.</p>
<p>	It would be so easy for me to just walk up and put a bullet into his back. It would be over quickly and easily, except the sound of the gunfire would be way too loud. Maybe I could stab him in the back with the torture blade I took from the room. That would not make a sound, and it would probably be very effective if I got him right around the neck.</p>
<p>	Can I stab a man with no warning, though, expecting him to die? No, I can not stoop to their level and kill whoever I want to. I will do whatever it takes to try and stop these monsters, but I will not willingly kill everyone who stands in my way. That will make me no better than the people I am trying to stop.</p>
<p>	I know I have already led to the death of at least a few men in the last couple of days, but all of them were self-defense, and I had no choice if I was going to survive. I will only kill if absolutely necessary for my own survival or the survival of innocent people. It is the only way I will be able to live with myself when this ordeal is over.</p>
<p>	Slowly and quietly as possible, I walk up behind the oblivious guard. I notice he has a pistol sitting in a holster on his belt, and stretching below the holster is a long black tube I can only guess is some kind of suppressor. A silenced weapon would make stealth a lot easier if it comes to a shootout in this factory.</p>
<p>	I sneak up until I am only inches from the man's back. He yawns in boredom and brings his right hand up to cover his mouth. When he does, I swiftly pull the weapon out of the holster and jab it into his back.</p>
<p>	He jumps in surprise, but I whisper behind him, "Don't move or I will put a bullet straight through you." I grab his shoulder with my other hand and pull him back towards a closet door marked, "Maintenance."</p>
<p>	I take my hand off the guard's shoulder long enough to open the door, then I shove him inside. He falls on the floor, and I command him, "Take your handcuffs and lock yourself to that pipe in the corner." A thick black pipe runs from floor to ceiling in the room. There is no way he would be able to break it or get out. The man reaches for his handcuffs and snaps one on his wrist, then moves to do the other one.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, a knife comes flying towards my face. I dodge at the last second, and see the man about to spring at me. The knife missed me, but not by much. I feel a stinging on my cheek and know the knife was inches from burying itself in my flesh.</p>
<p>	As the soldier is about to lunge for me and my gun, I aim at his kneecap and fire the suppressed pistol. He falls back to the floor as blood sprays from his knee.</p>
<p>	I quickly jump on top of the soldier and stuff a rag, lying on a shelf nearby, into his mouth to prevent him from alerting his comrades. I fasten the other cuff to his wrist, securing him to the pole. Quickly searching the guard's belt, I remove his handcuff keys and a few extra clips of ammo.</p>
<p>	Blood oozes out of his knee and spreads in a puddle on the floor. I grab all the extra rags I can find and wrap them around his leg to stop the flow of blood. I know he just tried to kill me, but there is no way I can leave him here to bleed out.</p>
<p>	The injured man squirms in intense pain and pulls at his handcuffs. "Maybe you should have listened to me. I didn't want to shoot you, but it was the only way I could stop you from attacking me. I hope you can survive this," I say to the man.</p>
<p>	Using the last rag, I make a tourniquet a few inches above his knee to reduce the flow of blood. I wrap the rag tightly around his leg, then use a long socket wrench to twist it tighter. Before approaching the door, I say to the man, "Keep your leg elevated, and hope my mission is successful. Even if you did try to kill me, I will send help for you as soon as I can."</p>
<p>	I swiftly back out the door and once again sneak down the corridor. I reach the end of the hallway and look out on a vast area filled with boxes. This must be the shipping floor, because everything is boxed up and there are no machinery or hostages in sight.</p>
<p>	Twenty soldiers stand around in varying degrees of alertness. Some lounge about as though they are on break and others march back and forth in front of the exits. The latter look ready to shoot anything that looks out of place.</p>
<p>	Where would they engineer the mind control chips at this factory? This seems to only be a shipping floor, they must do the manufacturing on the higher floors. Stefan said they were building the devices here so they must be somewhere.</p>
<p>	A set of freight elevators sit in the back wall of the room. The corridor I am in sits in the middle of the wall to the right of the elevators. I could use the elevators to get to the upper floors. Those two elevators sit at least a hundred feet away from me, and with all the guards on this level, there is not much chance I could make it to them without getting caught.</p>
<p>	Even from this distance, I can tell there are three floor numbers that light up on top of the elevator. This is floor one, and above is floor two. There is also a basement below me. I am guessing the chip manufacturing takes place on the floor above.</p>
<p>	Sitting fairly close to the elevator is a heavy metal door, and I can barely make out a plaque on it that reads, "Stairs." That is where I need to go, but it will not be easy with all these guards around. I would like to get past these soldiers without raising any suspicion, but that will be easier said than done. The last thing I want now is to start a gunfight with twenty soldiers.</p>
<p>	After taking a moment to study the guards hanging out and patrolling the shipping floor, I begin to see a predictable pattern. At one point in their routine, all of them have a blind eye to the path between me and the stairs due to a build up of boxes on the floor. I count the amount of time I have to run. Ten seconds is all I will get. That is not enough time for me to make it from here to the door, but I have to try anyway.</p>
<p>	I really hope they stay in this pattern for at least a few more cycles. The next time all of them have their backs turned, I take a deep breath to calm myself, then run as quickly and quietly as possible toward the door. I stop halfway behind a large pallet of boxes still covered in plastic wrap. I will wait for the next time around to try for the door.</p>
<p>	Sneaking a peak out from behind the boxes, I see the soldiers once again have a blind eye to me. I sprint for the door and twist the handle, squeezing myself into the smallest crack I can manage, to avoid opening the door too far.</p>
<p>	The door opens easily, but only slowly goes shut. It must shut slowly by itself to avoid closing on someone. I pull as hard as I can to speed up the process, but the door does not go into place as fast as I would have liked. Judging by the amount of time the guards had their backs turned away, one of them might have noticed the door in motion.</p>
<p>	I make it a few steps up the stairs when I hear voices on the other side of the door. I barely hear a voice say, "Did you see this door move, or am I going crazy?"</p>
<p>	I freeze for a second on the stairs then break into action. Vaulting over the metal handrail to the ground, I tuck myself into a niche created by the flight of the rising concrete stairs. As soon as I am out of sight, the handle of the door turns, and two soldiers with their weapons drawn move into the narrow stairway.</p>
<p>	The men's steps move slowly up the stairs right above my head. The steps grow quieter as the soldiers move to the top of the stairs. After a few seconds, the footsteps become louder as the two men come back down. I will have to pray that they do not think to look under the stairs.</p>
<p>	"There is nothing here, you must have been imagining things. Tell the Colonel you need a break or something. How long have you been on shift?" one soldier says to the other. The other one responds, "I have been on shift for a few hours, maybe I do need a break if I am seeing things."</p>
<p>	I hear the door open and then shut. Breathing a sigh of relief, I know for now I am safe.</p>
<p>	Moving slowly up the stairs, I make it to the second floor landing. A large metal door with a 2 resting in the middle stands in front of me. The stairway does not continue any higher.</p>
<p>	Pressing down the handle of the door, I open the door as quietly as possible. I only move the door the slightest of a crack, to get a good look at what I am heading into. Through the crack I can see a large section of hallway that stretches far into the distance. The crack I peer through does not allow me to see the ends of the hallway.</p>
<p>	White tile floor, with no color in it whatsoever besides the cracks that run vertically and horizontally through it, stretch far down the hall. The walls are a solid light green broken only by large picture windows and the occasional branch of a hallway.</p>
<p>	From the small area I can see through the crack, I can make out four hallways that branch off of the main one I am looking down, and four long windows sit between the halls. The only thing I can see inside of the windows is a dazzling bright white light.</p>
<p>	No one seems to be in the hallway, so I open the door far enough to stick my head out and get a  better look around. The door I just opened sits in the middle of the main hallway, and numerous smaller halls branch off the main one on either side.</p>
<p>	The hallways seem deserted, but there are few places to hide if any soldiers were to show up. Crouching down because I have no idea if anyone is looking out of the bright white windows, I move until I am directly underneath one of them. I peer over the edge, and after my eyes adjust to the light inside the room, I realize why the inside of the room looks as it does.</p>
<p>	The place is a clean room. Of course, they would have to use sterilized laboratories if they are going to make computer chips that insert into a person's brain. That is why the factory is set up like this. I have to stop them from manufacturing these chips.</p>
<p>	As I am looking into the clean room trying to think of my next course of action, I hear the opening of a door, followed by the sound of numerous footsteps coming down the hall. It sounds as if a large group of people are coming directly toward me. The sound is coming from a hallway that runs parallel to mine on the other side of the clean rooms.</p>
<p>	I move to the edge of my section of the hallway and peek around the corner. A group of people, led by a man with an assault rifle, march down the hallway. None of the people are talking, and everyone's face, except for the armed soldier's, is stricken with fear.</p>
<p>	At the far back of the group, I see another armed soldier marching behind. The fifteen people forced to march in the middle of the two soldiers are all wearing solid black jumpsuits that match the one I was put into while unconscious.</p>
<p>	These must be hostages that the soldiers are using to help them manufacture the chip. I need to free these people, and maybe they can help me stop the production of Stefan's chip. I have to get in with them and find out where they are going.</p>
<p>	As the group of people walk past my branch of the hallway, I press my back up against the wall closest to the approaching soldier. I make sure my firearm and knife are secured in pockets on the jumpsuit.</p>
<p>	The armed soldier leading the group does not see me and continues to lead the hostages down the hall. Seconds after he passes, I sidestep into the group and match their stride. The hostage next to me looks up in surprise for a moment, but I put my finger to my lips, signaling to him to be quiet. He gets the hint and stays quiet. The soldier bringing up the rear does not notice me either, and we continue marching down the hall.</p>
<p>	The soldiers march us to a door marked, "Clean Room C1" and motion for us to go inside. Then the lead soldier commands the hostages, "Go in and change into your clean suits. We will be inside in five minutes to make sure everyone is changed and ready to go. If you do not have on your clean suit in five minutes, you will be shot."</p>
<p>	The soldier opens the door and motions for us to enter. We walk past him, and I look toward my feet as I shuffle into the room. I do not know if he would recognize I am not one of the usual hostages, but I am not willing to take the chance. The soldiers remain outside of the door, and then they close it behind us.</p>
<p>	As soon as the door is closed, everyone moves towards a locker and begins hastily putting on their clean suits. I move over to a locker that no one else approaches and open it. A white suit hangs from a hook in the locker, and on an eye-level shelf sit a surgical mask and a pair of goggles.</p>
<p>	The clean suits go right over the top of our jumpsuits, and everyone puts their clean suit on in the next five minutes. As people put on their suits they catch a few quick words of conversation with one another. Most of them sound terrified, and hopeful that someone will come and save them. No one mentions taking the initiative to fight back themselves.</p>
<p>	The clean suits have a white hood that fits snugly onto the head and though the face is exposed, it is covered with the surgical mask and a pair of goggles. The man who noticed me get into line next to him puts his things on faster than everybody else, then comes over to stand at the locker next to mine.</p>
<p>	"You are not from our group of prisoners. Who are you, and how did you come here?" the man says to me in a voice barely audible since it is muffled by his surgical mask.</p>
<p>	"My name is Mark Stetson, and I just escaped from Doctor Stefan's office. The rest is a long story that I don't have time to explain to you now, but hopefully I can later. What is your name, and can I trust that you would like to get out of this situation?"</p>
<p>	"Yes, I will do anything I can to get out of this. I haven't seen my family for almost a week, and I don't even know if they are alive or dead. Let me do something against these monsters so I can find my family. My name is Steve Sanders," the man replies with desperation in his voice.</p>
<p>	"Alright, here is the plan," I say. "Those soldiers are going to come in here ready to shoot, because they have left us alone for five minutes and might suspect hostility. Do the soldiers come into the clean room with you?" Steve nods in assent.</p>
<p>	They must care more about making sure the workers do their job correctly than that the room is entirely contaminate free. Positioning the armed guards in there in their fatigues can not be the most sanitary.</p>
<p>	I say to Steve, "Okay, I am going to cut a slit in my pants and yours since these clean suits are lacking pockets." Using the bladed hook I took from Doctor's Stefan, I cut a hole in the side of my clean suit next to my hip just big enough for me to reach my hand into. I place my silenced pistol in my inner jumpsuit pocket. After making sure I am able to pull the gun out if needed, I pass the blade to Steve.</p>
<p>	He takes the knife from me, looking somewhat apprehensive about using it. I tell him, "Alright, now make a slit in the side of your clean suit so you have somewhere to stash that knife. Once we get into the clean room, put the knife at one of the guard's throats, and I will cover the other one with the pistol. If we can do this without killing them, I would feel better about it."</p>
<p>	Steve nods, letting me know he understands.</p>
<p>	As we finish up our conversation, the last of the people finish putting on their clean suits. None of the other individuals seem to notice Steve and I passing weapons to each other. Everyone faces straight ahead in front of their lockers.</p>
<p>	All of them are so absorbed in their own quickly grabbed bits of conversation. Maybe the five minutes granted to these individuals to change into clean suits is some of the only truly free conversation time these people get each day.</p>
<p>	Once the five minutes is up, the door swings open and the two soldiers stroll into the room with their weapons raised, ready to shoot anyone that gives them an excuse. No one does, so the men relax and lower their weapons.</p>
<p>	"Aww, that's too bad. We were hoping someone wouldn't get changed and we would be able to shoot somebody today," one of the men says as he randomly punches a hostage in the gut. The man doubles up in pain, but stops himself from falling to the floor.</p>
<p>	The soldier's weapon is almost instantly aimed at the man's face. "Go ahead and fall to the ground. Then I can say I shot you for being lazy," the soldier says to him.</p>
<p>	These men are unnecessarily brutal. If I have to shoot one of them, I do not think I would feel very bad. My hand grips the pistol tighter in my pocket, ready to draw and fire if the soldier's finger moves any closer to the trigger of his assault rifle.</p>
<p>	After a few seconds of intimidation, he lowers his rifle, and the man staggers back to stand at his full height. The soldier gestures with the tip of his weapon toward the airlock to the clean room, and says, "Let's get to work."</p>
<p>	All of us in white suits begin shuffling toward the airlock. I see Steve position himself directly behind the soldier leading the front of our line. I stand toward the back of the line, ready to draw my weapon on the soldier bringing up the rear as soon as Steve makes his move.</p>
<p>	We shuffle into the airlock, which is a cube shaped room just large enough for all of us to fit inside. The glass door in front of us remains shut as we shuffle forward. Once we are all in, another glass door slides shut behind us, effectively sealing us all into the airlock. My eyes are trained on Steve, waiting for him to pull out the knife.</p>
<p>	Immediately after the rear door touches the floor, the white lights of the airlock switch to crimson red. Nozzles in the wall emit a thick spray of  translucent white smoke, that quickly bathes everyone. This spray must kill any germs that are present on the clean suits.</p>
<p>	As soon as the spray covers the people in line, I see the red lights glint off Steve's knife. The blade is instantly on the front soldier's throat. Once he has the soldier under control, I pull the silenced pistol out of my pocket, and spin around to aim it at the soldier behind me.</p>
<p>	The instant the rear soldier realizes what is happening, he begin to raise his assault rifle. I quickly take aim with my pistol and fire off a shot. My bullet ricochets off the metal stock of his assault rifle and buries itself into the wall behind him. The soldier drops his weapon to the ground in surprise.</p>
<p>	The soldier raises his hands into the air in surrender. I quickly glance behind me to see Steve holding the other soldier's assault rifle. The man he took it from is on his knees with his hands on top of his head.</p>
<p>	Loudly I say to the soldier in front of me, "Get on your knees and put your hands on top of your head." He obeys me with no sign of resistance, and I stoop to pick up the assault weapon while still keeping the pistol pointed at the man's chest.</p>
<p>	The airlock finishes its cycle, and the glass door to the clean room slides open. I see a bundle of cords running between some of the machines. Trying to figure out what to do with these soldiers, I say, "Steve, take the knife and cut some of those cords so we can tie these two men up."</p>
<p>	He runs to do what I ask while I cover the two hostiles on their knees. A few of the other people in their clean suits move to help Steve. A few sparks fly from the machines as their cords are cut.</p>
<p>	After the two soldiers are secured tightly with the loose wires, I remove my goggles and mask. Once I pull off my white clean suit, I address the people in the room. They begin to take off their face masks and goggles as well. All of them look very glad to be able to turn the tables on their captors.</p>
<p>	I say to the group, "My name is Mark Stetson. I am here to try and save you from the people who have taken you hostage. Help me fight back against these monsters so we can all go back to our lives."</p>
<p>	As soon as I say this, a cheer rings through the former hostages in the airlock. Some begin to hug one another, and everyone has a smile of hope on their face.</p>
<p>	One man runs out of the crowd toward where Steve stands with the tied up soldiers. I realize he is the man the soldier punched in the stomach and threatened earlier. He kicks the soldier square in the face with his rubber boot. Blood sprays from the soldier's nose, blemishing the sanitary white surface of the airlock.</p>
<p>	After kicking the soldier, the freed hostage turns to me and says, "We will do whatever we can to help get rid of these parasites."</p>
<p>	Everyone looks at me expectantly. They need me to stand up and be a leader. They need me to tell them what to do. I do not shrink from the task. All the fear of public speaking and indecision I usually feel is gone, and only a desire to help these people remains.</p>
<p>	"Does anybody know if there are other hostages being kept at this facility?" I ask, ready to get the ball rolling on taking out this factory and saving as many innocent people as possible.</p>
<p>	Steve replies, "There is another group of hostages being kept inside a group of storage containers in a field right outside the building. The field is surrounded by a chain-link fence with razor wire on top. All of us here were workers at this factory, and they retrained us to work on some different kind of chip design than we are used to. Normally this factory deals in the research and development of personal computer chips, but after the takeover, we were given new schematics and forced at gunpoint to make a chip none of us had ever seen before.</p>
<p>	I say, "That chip you were supposed to design was a behavioral modification device Doctor Stefan invented. How many have you made already?"</p>
<p>	Steve answers, "Do you mean those chips were to be used for some sort of mind control? Wow. I have no idea how many have been made so far. We have been putting them together for a few days. Most of them must still be on the shipping floor, because we have not seen very many transport trucks leave the area. We did not know what these chips did, but guessed they had some nefarious purpose, so we tried to keep track of them as well as we could from inside the fence. Only a few trucks capable of transporting the boxes of chips have left here.</p>
<p>	That means some of the chips got out. The two inventors of the chip are now dead, and hopefully with the destruction of this factory, the schematics for how to build it will be destroyed as well. If those crates I saw on the shipping floor contain the chips, then the best way to destroy them would be to burn this factory to the ground.</p>
<p>	I can try and track down the chips that got out later. Hopefully, I can stop them before they are implanted in the Congressmen who have been taken hostage.</p>
<p>	Trying to come up with a plan, I say to the group, "Okay, does anyone know the fastest way we can stop this factory from making more chips?"</p>
<p>	A woman speaks up from amongst the freed hostages, "If the schematic for the chip is saved in the computer mainframe, the fastest way to destroy the schematic would be to destroy the computer. I would be willing to burn this factory to the ground if it helps to stop these monsters. We can always rebuild once they are gone."</p>
<p>	Everyone else in the room seems to agree.</p>
<p>	A man in the back raises his hand and says, "I'm Max, and I usually work in the maintenance department. I know of a way that we can destroy this factory. The airlocks use pure oxygen during their cycle process. I can release the safeguards that keep the system in check. Then it would only take someone to release expose the air in the basement to an open flame."</p>
<p>	"Alright," I say, "We have to destroy this facility completely, and hopefully in doing so we can destroy any traces of Doctor Stefan's behavioral modification chips. The men who designed it are already dead, so once the schematic of its design are destroyed, no one else should know how to make one. Nobody should be able to control or influence someone's mind with a computer chip."</p>
<p>	Stepping up as a leader, I start assigning responsibilities.</p>
<p>	We have to get the hostages out before the factory is destroyed.</p>
<p>	"Steve, I want you to lead these people out of the building. Once you are out, do whatever it takes to free the other hostages. Take the assault rifles we secured from these soldiers, and use them if necessary. Take the soldiers we tied up with you, and try to get everyone out of here alive," I say.</p>
<p>	Now for the more dangerous part.</p>
<p>	"Max, I need you to go remove the safeguards like you talked about from the airlocks. I will go and light the fire in the basement. How do I get there?"</p>
<p>	"A few of the stairways and the elevator should be able to take you there.	You will need a maintenance key to grant you access to the basement, and none of us have one. Once you get into the basement, it's easy to spot. The tank is large and silver and has signs on it saying highly flammable and compressed oxygen. You are going to have to rupture the tank and then expose it to some kind of flame. That should start a fire that could burn this factory to the ground," he says.</p>
<p>	I continue, "Alright, I will figure out how to get a maintenance key. I am going on alone to find that oxygen tank."</p>
<p>	At hearing this, Steve objects, "Take some of us with you. We can help." I ponder this for a second, knowing the decision could have dire consequences.</p>
<p>	Most of these people look too much in shock to be of any use to me. Besides, they will need all the help they can get to free those hostages. I have made it this far mostly by myself anyway. At this thought, Sara flashes through my mind. I hope she is safe.</p>
<p>	I reply, "No, I want all of you to work together to free those hostages. I can move with more stealth alone, and will have a better chance of finding that oxygen tank before I am discovered. Once the hostages are freed, move everyone you can into the forest. That's where the Doctor said the resistance fighters were holed up while attacking the factory. I will see you all there. Good Luck." 	With those final words, we cycle the airlock again and move out into the hallway. Steve hands one of the two assault rifles to Max and keeps the other one for himself. Steve leads the freed hostages down the hall from the direction I first saw them coming from.</p>
<p>	Max heads down a separate hallway and heads out of sight. I hope he can get the safeguards removed before I blow that oxygen tank or this might be an exercise in futility.</p>
<p>	I watch them go for a few seconds and pray that they will be able to get everyone out before I execute my part of the plan. I run down the hall, in the opposite direction from Steve and the factory workers, back to the staircase that leads to the shipping area.</p>
