<h3> Chapter 14 </h3>
<p>After walking for almost an hour, sweating in the hot sun of the afternoon, I finally arrive about a block away from the fenced in facility I had spied from the elevated freeway. Not daring to get too close before I know more about what is going on, I hide in the alley behind a jewelry store just close enough to safely watch the area from a distance.</p>
<p>	A grass field stretches across the street from the group of buildings where I have hidden myself. In the center of this field sits a chain link fence covering the distance about as long as a football field. The top of the fence is lined with thick rolls of razor wire spiraling around in a deadly circle preventing anyone from climbing over.</p>
<p>	Within the fence sits a two-story building with numerous garage doors spaced evenly across the lower and upper floors. A metal walkway leads up to the second story and stretches around the building to give access to the upper floors. A large sign in front of the building says "Jim's Storage."</p>
<p>	Groups of people mill about in the grass area between the building and the fence. The majority of these people are garbed in orange jumpsuits, but do not look much like hardened criminals. Individuals of all ages and types are congregated together.</p>
<p>	The only people not wearing orange have on black and look all too familiar. Soldiers in body armor, looking exactly like the ones trying to kill me, monitor the group of people. The guards are equipped with assault rifles and shotguns, the latter probably for riot control more than assault.</p>
<p>	In two corners of the fence sit green armored vehicles with heavy mounted machine guns on top. The men sitting behind the gun train the weapons in a steady circle, aiming them at the residents of the facility for a while, then panning out towards the area outside the fence. Are they using this storage facility as some kind of prison?</p>
<p>	As I watch, one of the soldiers yells an order, and a garage door of the facility opens up. There is nothing inside except a few military style cots, a blue portable toilet, and bare concrete walls. People in orange who were walking around the yard begin to tightly pack themselves inside the storage unit. After all the people are shut inside, the door shuts behind them.</p>
<p>	If they are using this as a prison, they are not treating these people very humanely. There are way too many people stuffed into that storage container for them to be comfortable.</p>
<p>	Immediately after the other door closes, the next garage door opens up, and all the people inside walk out into the grass as they stretch their limbs. The people walk emerge onto the field offering no resistance to their heavily armed captors.</p>
<p>	I wish I could help these people escape. I do not know why they are here, or what is planned for them, but I have to get them out of there. If they treat these people like they treated me, they could all be killed, but what can I do? They have vehicles with mounted machine guns and more than twenty soldiers with shotguns and rifles. I have a pistol, I would not stand a chance.</p>
<p>	While I sit thinking of a plan, a sudden commotion catches my attention. A guard begins to strike a young boy with the butt of his assault rifle. As the boy falls to his knees with blood smearing his face, the guards around start to laugh.</p>
<p>	None of the people in orange move to help him. They all just stare as he is beaten, looking as though they want to help, but none are willing to put their own life at risk. The rifle goes up one more time to crash into the boys face when a girl with brown hair runs out of the crowd. She shoves the guard as hard as she can causing him to stumble backward. The soldier's rifle falls to the ground, and everyone freezes.</p>
<p>	The men behind the guns in the vehicles immediately train them on the girl. The guard she pushed is on her immediately and pulls his pistol from its holster. He presses the gun against her forehead as she stands defiantly in front of him unflinching. The boy with the bloody face scrambles back into the crowd as the attention of the guards is no longer on him.</p>
<p>	Other guards come running up, and one of them rests his hand on the soldier who is holding the pistol. I see him point outside of the fence towards a wooded area to the left of my position. The guard seems to relax a little and lowers his weapon. He immediately moves behind the girl, securing her hands behind her back.</p>
<p>	The girl is led by two guards toward the gate in the front of the facility. One of the guards has his hand latched to her arm pulling her forward, and the other walks behind her with his assault rifle ready. I have to get over there, they are going to kill her. She was the only one who stood up to those guards, I can not let her get shot.</p>
<p>	I scramble over to the area where the guards are headed, but I make sure I stay out of sight. The men lead the girl into the large clump of trees and out of sight of the storage facility. I hide behind a tree and pull my one remaining pistol from my pocket, waiting for the best opportunity to use it. The men push the girl onto her knees in a small clearing within the surrounding pine and oak trees.</p>
<p>	At this point, I finally get a chance to see the girl. She is strikingly pretty with flowing brown hair. The thing that catches my attention most though is her eyes. Gorgeous emerald green eyes peer out with a fiery hatred, looking for an opportunity to fight back against the guards keeping her captive.</p>
<p>	One of the soldiers turns to the other and says, "We don't have to kill her just yet, do we? Why don't we have some fun with her first? Just look how pretty she is." As he says this, he strokes her face with his gloved hand, and I can see a visible shudder run through the girl. A tear rolls down her face and falls to the ground beneath her.</p>
<p>	"That sounds good to me as long as I get a turn before we off her," the other guard replies. The first man begins to remove some of his heavy body armor, taking off his helmet and bulletproof vest until he is only in a black jumpsuit. He reaches down to touch her as I aim the pistol at the man's exposed head and fire.</p>
<p>	The gunshot cracks through the woods, and the man collapses to the ground with crimson running out of his head creating a steady stream in the dirt. The girl looks too shocked to react for a second, and a look of confusion washes over the face of the other guard. I fire a bullet in his direction, but the man recollects his wits in enough time to dodge the shot.</p>
<p>	A rapid succession of gunfire erupts from the man's assault rifle in my direction. I quickly dodge by spinning behind a tree, but can hear and feel the powerful shots digging into the bark on the other side. The shots stop, so I peak out to see if the man is reloading. The moment I do, more shots fly past my face close enough I can feel their heat as they speed past.</p>
<p>	I aim my pistol beside the tree, but hesitate before I fire. I can not take the risk of hitting the girl in my attempt to save her. She deserves to make it out of this alive.</p>
<p>	I look out from behind the tree to get a clear shot and gunfire once again bursts from the man's rifle. As soon as the shots begin, the girl spins on her knees and kicks out with one leg. She strikes the soldier's shin, causing him to fall to the ground.</p>
<p>	I run out from behind the tree as the fallen guard moves his aim from me to the girl. His finger moves toward the trigger of his rifle, but I pull the trigger of my pistol first. My bullet hits the man in the exposed area around his neck. He falls to the ground and lies still after the shot. The clearing is suddenly eerily silent after all the commotion.</p>
<p>	The binds on the girls arms are secure, but not difficult to untie. As soon as I release her hands, she turns around and looks at me. I begin to say, "Hi, my name is Mark," but only get half of it out before she throws her arms around me in a warm embrace. She keeps repeating, "Thank you, thank you, thank you," in my ear before releasing me and properly introducing herself.</p>
<p>	"My name's Sara," she gasps out, still breathing hard from her near death experience. "Thank you for saving my life, and saving me from whatever these monsters would have done to me. I don't know who you are, but all I can say is thank you."</p>
<p>	"I'm Mark, and I'm glad I was able to help you in time. Sorry to be so forward after what just happened, but do you have any idea is going on here?</p>
