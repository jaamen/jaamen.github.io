<h3> Chapter 10 </h3>
<p>I yell as loud as I can at the top of my lungs in an attempt to let the other soldiers know I am serious, "Stop moving or I will shoot him!" I now have a death grip on the man in front of me, using his body as a human shield. His pistol is my only weapon to hold off the other soldiers. There is no time to get the assault rifle laying on the floor in front of me.</p>
<p>	The soldiers continue to close in on me in the narrow aisle. I figure they will stop their advance and try to talk me out of killing their comrade, buying me some more time. I am dead wrong. All hell breaks loose in the once quiet space. Explosions fill the deserted grocery store as the men open fire, not caring if they hit their fellow soldier.</p>
<p>	I can feel the man's body I am holding in front of me shudder as each bullet strikes his body. I know he has full body armor on, but with three men emptying fully automatic rifles at him at close range, he is not going to last long. After a salvo of bullets, I feel the man go limp as he either dies or loses consciousness. I know that body armor prevents bullets from entering the skin, but the person wearing it still feels the force of each bullet.</p>
<p>	I drag the man with me backwards trying to reach the relative safety of the end of the aisle. Bullets continue to pepper the man's armor in front of me. Bullets fly all around, striking packages of food on both sides of the aisle causing them to explode. Bits of food spray into the dimly lit area now illuminated by the muzzle flashes of the rifles.</p>
<p>	I reach my handgun over my human shield's shoulder and fire a few shots at my attackers. The hail of gunfire stops. Did I hit one of them? Still backing up, I am almost at the end of the aisle. The soldiers continue to advance toward me. I had not hit any of them, they only stopped shooting to put fresh ammo clips into their weapons.</p>
<p>	I drop my human shield and stand out of the path of bullets at the end of the aisle. I lean out and shoot a few rounds from my pistol to hinder the progress of the soldiers. They each try to move out of the way, but I hit one of them in the chest. He briefly staggers down to one knee, but stands back up almost immediately. That body armor will stop almost every round I shoot at them from this pistol. The men continue to charge at me.</p>
<p>	Realizing my handgun must be nearly out of bullets I stop firing to save my ammo. What am I going to do? Once they reach the end of the aisle, my only option is to run, but how long can I outrun them before I take one of their bullets?</p>
<p>	I risk another glance to see the progress of my attackers. One of them is running down the aisle in the opposite direction, and the other two have slowed to a walk as they approach me. They are going to try and flank me from the other side. Gunfire erupts almost as seen as the soldiers see my face, and I shift back away from the deadly bullets.</p>
<p>	In the split second I looked into the aisle, I realized something. The assault rifle of the soldier I used as a human shield is almost in reach. The strap of the weapon caught on the man's boot and followed us as I pulled him with me. The weapon is out of reach, but the dead soldier whose leg it is attached to is not.</p>
<p>	I grab the fallen soldier's arm as it is the closest part of him and begin to pull the limp body closer. This man was probably not light to begin with, but that heavy body armor makes him even more difficult to pull.</p>
<p>	I know two men are advancing on me from this aisle, and there could be two more coming at me from different directions. I have to get a hold of that weapon or I am dead.</p>
<p>	The body with the gun attached to the foot is closer now, but I realize I am going to run out of time before the soldiers are right on top of me. The weapon is so close its strap is less than two feet from me. I can not reach out for it or I will be in full view of two men with guns who want to kill me.</p>
<p>	I have to do something now. They will be right on top of me in a few seconds. There is a brief pause in the gunfire, and I look out to see the two soldiers putting more ammo into their weapons as they continue to approach.</p>
<p>	I spring out, firing the remaining bullets from my handgun at my assailants, and distract them from reloading their weapons. I firmly grasp the stock of the machine gun on the floor. I spin out of sight again behind the next aisle as the soldiers finish reloading. More gunfire erupts, hitting the shelves on the back wall of the store.</p>
<p>	With the assault rifle in hand, I muster my courage and point the weapon into the aisle at the approaching men. I pull the trigger and a burst of bullets fires from the gun. The weapon rattles in my hand violently, and I was not expecting the amount of force the recoil produced. My bullets spray wildly in the aisle, most of them going too high to be dangerous.</p>
<p>	I reset the weapon firmly against my shoulder and step out in view of my attackers. Using a tighter grip to hold the gun down, I pull the trigger to keep the bullets right on target. The men are still trying to load their weapons and have no cover to hide behind in the aisle. I fire two quick bursts, striking one of the soldiers in his core, and then quickly readjusting my aim onto the other man as the first falls to the floor. The second man collapses on the ground next to the first.</p>
<p>	The two men lie still on the floor. I do not know if those bullets penetrated the armor or not. I do not want to have to kill anyone, but it is either them or me. I run over and quickly check them for useful gear.</p>
<p>	Their assault rifles lay unloaded. I have no idea how to load one of these things so those rifles are useless to me. I think there are still some shots left in my own rifle, so I keep it. I take the men's handguns and stick one in each of my front pockets.</p>
<p>	There are still two soldiers in here, and I do not know where they are. At least I have some means to protect myself now. I move to the front of the store hoping I can slip out without being seen by the two remaining men. They are nowhere in sight when I approach the front of the store. I sprint and duck behind one of the checkout lanes near the front exit.</p>
<p>	After waiting a few seconds, one of the men walks out from the aisle parallel to where the other three men were shot. At the same time, the final soldier walks out from the aisle on the other side of the one with the three fallen men. They must have been trying to trap me from three different sides. Apparently they did not think I would be able to get past two heavily armed soldiers.</p>
<p>	"Did you see where he went?" the first soldier asks the second.</p>
<p>	"No, but he got two of us, and we took out one of ours to get to him. This guy must be good, he almost destroyed our whole team. I radioed for back up. Stay alert and let's stick together. We will wait for reinforcements to arrive," the other soldier replies.</p>
<p>	The men stand back to back and move toward the exit, holding their assault rifles in front of them nervously. They will probably head for their vehicle, because it is most likely reinforced against bullets. I have to get out of here before back-up arrives. I can maybe hold off a couple of soldiers, but not many more than that for long.</p>
<p>	Staying low, I move toward the door with the broken glass hoping to slip out unnoticed before the two soldiers reach it. I am out of their line of sight due to the checkout lanes, and I manage to step through the broken door and into the fresh air. The second I make it outside, another black SUV pulls up and parks behind the first. Reinforcements have arrived. Good thing I got out when I did.</p>
<p>	I can not go back into the store because the two men moving toward the exit will spot me. I dive in front of the first SUV, hoping I am not spotted by the newcomers. The two men inside the store step out as the doors of the second SUV click open.</p>
<p>	I hear the rustle of gear being adjusted, and five men step out of the second vehicle. I lay as flat as possible and slowly begin crawling under the first SUV as the men move toward the entrance of the store. Completely under the vehicle and out of sight, I can hear their entire conversation.</p>
<p>	"What is going on here?" a voice says.</p>
<p>	A second voice replies, "I don't know, we found signs of an intruder so we investigated. After we went in, someone inside attacked our team and killed three of our men. We had to call for backup to make sure we can get this guy. He is armed and extremely dangerous."</p>
<p>	"Just one guy killed three trained commandos?"</p>
<p>	"Yeah, I don't know how he did it. I would have put him down if I had seen him, but he is holed up in there somewhere now, and I figured we should call in reinforcements to help flush him out."</p>
<p>	"Okay men, we have a highly dangerous individual hiding out in this store. We are going to go in two pairs of three and start at opposite ends of the store and converge in the middle. If we don't spot him before converging, we will run the security footage from the store to see where he is at. Jenkins will stay at the front of the store to make sure no one gets out while we are inside. Any questions?" 	There are a few seconds of silence, and then the voice continues, "Okay good. Let's move out and find this guy so we can put him down."</p>
