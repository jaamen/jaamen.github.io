<h3> Chapter 28 </h3>
<p>Awakening the next morning, I have a brief moment of bliss where I am completely oblivious to my current situation. At first, I think I am home alone in my own bed, and the past few days events were a bad dream. Only after focusing my eyes on the foliage surrounding me do I recall all that has happened. The numerous injuries I sustained are another reminder, and throb with the slightest movement.</p>
<p>Rolling over in my makeshift bed, a sight strikes my eyes that makes some of this ordeal a whole lot better. Sara is lying on a sleeping bag only a few feet away from mine. The rising sun shines through the trees and a few rays rest on her face casting it in a warm glow.</p>
<p>	I remember talking to her the entire evening and long after the sun had set. I also remember what I asked her not too long before we went to sleep. "If we make it out of this, would you want to go out with me some time?"</p>
<p>	Even with my new found confidence I was still nervous to ask the question. Before this whole ordeal there is no way I would have had the courage to ask out a girl as pretty as her. Her answer made me feel like it was flying, and I barely felt the hard ground beneath my sleeping bag as I drifted off to sleep. "I would love to," she said.</p>
<p>	I sit up on my sleeping bag and realize I need to take a leak. After walking about a hundred feet away from the camp, I find a bush to relieve myself. Once I finish, I am zipping up my pants when I hear a gunshot in the trees in the direction of the camp.</p>
<p>	Almost instinctively, I quickly reach for my pistol, but realize I left it sitting in my sleeping bag. I swiftly run back to the camp but stop short and duck behind a fallen log. Enemy soldiers are in the camp, and they do not look friendly.</p>
<p>	Right in front of my eyes, the soldiers grab everyone and tie them up as soon as they wake. There are far more soldiers than resistance fighters and soon everyone has their hands secured behind their back. Smartly, most of them do not put up a fight after seeing the hopelessness of their situation.</p>
<p>	I see Sara with her hands tied behind her standing next to my sleeping bag. She looks around puzzled, because I am no where she can see. Her eyes briefly meet mine for a second and she mouths, "Help me."</p>
<p>	I am about to spring for the nearest soldier and attempt to wrestle his gun away in a desperate attempt to save everyone when a hand firmly grips my shoulder. I start to wrench away when I see it is John, and he has his index finger to his lips telling me to stay quiet.</p>
<p>	He whispers in my ear, "We can not do anything for them now, they will kill us all for sure. Let's follow them and strike when we get a better opportunity." The lines on his face show his concern for these people matches mine, and I reluctantly nod in agreement.</p>
<p>	Once the hostages are all secured together, Sara asks one of the soldiers, "Where are you taking us?"</p>
<p>	A soldier walks up to her. He says, "You are part of the reason why Rasputin's factory is burnt to the ground. This can not be tolerated and you must all be punished. We are going to take you in for a private meeting with Rasputin himself at his headquarters in the Bakersville Bank Tower. I am sure he will have some choice words for you."</p>
<p>	The soldiers laugh and begin pushing the line of captives forward with their weapons. This girl is amazing. She just let me know where the soldiers will be taking the captives. I meet Sara's eyes one more time and mouth to her, "I will come for you." She flashes a quick smile of hope to me, and begins to shuffle forward with the rest of the resistance fighters.</p>
<p>	John and I move quietly behind them, staying in cover at all times. Once they leave the area of the camp, I retrieve my pistol from my sleeping bag. I pick up a belt with a holster for my sidearm and attach it around me. John slings a hunting rifle with a scope over his back that was buried under a pile of leaves.</p>
<p>	"Your luck at avoiding capture is still going strong," John says to me.</p>
<p>	"I was taking a leak when they attacked, how did you get away?" I say.</p>
<p>	"I was patrolling in a different part of the forest and came back to find them on top of the rest of the resistance. They must have known right where we would be. Maybe they found another drone," he answers.</p>
<p>	"Do you have a plan to save our friends?" I ask John, hoping he does.</p>
<p>	He says to me, "We will wait until they get out of the tree line and into whatever vehicle they will use as transport. Then we will pick off as many soldiers as we can until they start looking for us in the trees. When the majority of the soldiers come into the trees to look for us, we will free our friends and finish off the rest of the assailants."</p>
<p>	I agree, knowing we do not have much of a choice if we want to get the captives out alive. I wish there was a way to do this without killing so many people, even if the soldiers would not return the same favor. Right now it is either shoot a few ruthless soldiers or let people I care about be killed. The choice is an easy one.</p>
<p>	We follow the soldiers from a safe distance. Once we arrive at the edge of the trees we are able to see a couple of large military trucks that look like they will be used to transport the captives to the downtown skyscraper where Rasputin is holed up.</p>
<p>	John looks at me and points to a fallen tree a few yards from the edge of the forest. I take the hint and move into position behind the moss covered log. From this spot, I should be able to take out a few of the soldiers with my pistol and remain undiscovered. At least, I hope so.</p>
<p>	John scrambles up into the higher branches of a tree thick with leaves. I am barely able to see him through the green foliage, and if I had not watched him climb up, I probably would not have been able to see him at all. He takes the rifle off of his shoulder and aims it outside of the trees.</p>
<p>	The gunshot rings loudly through the air, and between a gap in the trees I see a soldier fall to the ground and remain still. Before the soldiers can even react to the first gunshot, or their fallen compatriot, another shot rings out. One more soldier collapses to the ground in a heap.</p>
<p>	Immediately after the second shot, chaos ensues. The soldiers have no idea where the shots are coming from, but try to find cover wherever they can. Some run back toward the forest, and others hunker down on both sides of the truck with their weapons raised, scanning for signs of the shooter. The third shot rings out and another soldier is down. Three down, only twenty to go. We are still in a real pinch.</p>
<p>	Around ten of the soldiers run into the woods and find trees to hide behind. I take careful aim with my pistol and squeeze off a shot. The barely audible sound of my silenced weapon firing is hidden by the rustle of the soldiers moving through the trees. No one notices the shot except for the soldier who took my bullet in the neck. He falls to the forest floor and does not move.</p>
<p>	I hear shot after shot coming from John's tree and see soldier after soldier falling to the ground. Every time I hear a shot, a soldier goes down. He is an amazing sniper</p>
<p>	The captives are all still huddled together beside the truck, ducking down to avoid getting hit by stray gunfire. The second I think there might actually be hope of saving them, a group of soldiers hiding by the truck run out and quickly corral the resistance fighters into the back of the vehicle.</p>
<p>	I continue to fire my pistol at all the soldiers in the trees, but the truck and the people around it are out of my range. Stopping those soldiers from putting the captives in the truck is all up to John, I can not get a shot from this position.</p>
<p>	One of the soldiers forcing the hostages in the truck is struck by a bullet and goes down, and then another. Four soldiers remain next to the hostages. Suddenly, the loud report of John's hunting rifle suddenly stops. He must be out of ammo. We have to stop them another way.</p>
<p>	The majority of the soldiers in the forest are lying dead on the ground, so I rush from my hiding place and position myself at the very edge of the trees. All of the captured resistance fighters have been loaded into the truck and are out of sight because of a canvas topper covering the back. I fire off a few rounds at the few remaining soldiers as they hop inside of the vehicle.</p>
<p>	The truck begins to roll forward, and I fire my pistol at the driver. I miss and attempt to fire again but only hear a click. Out of ammo. No longer caring for my personal safety, I pick up one of the downed soldier's assault rifles and fire all of the rounds at the driver of the vehicle. The sound of the machine gun is deafening as it roars into the side of the truck filling the side door with holes.</p>
<p>	The vehicle grinds to a halt, and through the window I can see the driver's head fall forward to rest on the steering wheel. Before I am able to approach the vehicle, a soldier in the passenger seat throws open the bullet ridden door and shoves the dead soldier out. He scoots into the driver seat and floors the accelerator. The truck rockets forward and drives out of range down the road before I can pick up another weapon.</p>
<p>	John comes down out of the tree looking grim. I am sure the look on my face is not much better. He approaches me as I find a few clips from the soldiers to reload my pistol. I also take a fully loaded assault rifle.</p>
<p>	"I can not believe I let them get away. My gun jammed up from the repeated firing," John says, clearly angry with himself.</p>
<p>	"It's not your fault, you took down way more men then I ever could alone," I say, "Do you still have ammo for your rifle?"</p>
<p>	"Yeah, plenty more, and I hope to be able to use it on some more of those soldiers," John replies angrily.</p>
<p>	"What do we do now?" I say.</p>
<p>	He replies, "We know where they are going. Let's go get them, and take out anyone who stands in our way."</p>
