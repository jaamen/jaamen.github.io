<h3> Chapter 12 </h3>
<p>I reach for the grenade while still fumbling to maintain control of my vehicle. We enter onto an overpass section of the freeway, and to lose control now could mean careening over the guard rail and certain death. The grenade rolls just as I reach for it and slips from my fingers.</p>
<p>	Reaching for it again, I realize I have less than two seconds to get this thing out of the window. My fingers finally close on the deadly object, and I fling it out of the window as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>	The grenade travels out of my window almost in slow motion. I am able to track the path of the grenade in my rear-view mirror as it travels toward the pursing SUV. Please do not explode until a safe distance from my car. I see the airborne explosive as it is passes the driver side window of the other vehicle. The pursuing SUV's front bumper is only a few feet away from my back bumper.</p>
<p>	A second later, all hell breaks lose. With a deafening roar, the grenade detonates right beside the other SUV. The back end of my vehicle is thrown violently into the air, and I struggle to maintain control. The other vehicle is lost from sight as a piece of shrapnel from the grenade rips off the side mirror I was using to watch it.</p>
<p>	All of my rear windows are completely blown out, and I look back through the empty panes to see the other vehicle crash head on into a guard rail. The crushing force of the impact crumples the rail, and the vehicle topples over the edge of the freeway and falls completely out of sight.</p>
<p>	The back end of my vehicle is a mangled mess, and I push the brake to slow the reckless path of the out of control vehicle. Nothing happens. I let off and push the brake again, but my vehicle does not slow the slightest bit.</p>
<p>	In the distance I see a construction zone looming nearer as I crest the highest point of the overpass and begin the descent back down. With no brakes I begin to gain speed instead of lose it, and I fly into the construction zone at 80 mph with the needle of my speedometer still growing higher.</p>
<p>	The four lane freeway abruptly turns into two as I enter the construction area. Orange and white cones guide me into a single lane as I continue to struggle for control of my SUV. Signs saying "SLOW" and "45 MPH SPEED LIMIT" fly past me in an almost unrecognizable blur. Then I catch a sign saying "CAUTION, SHARP TURN AHEAD" and a shiver of panic rushes through me. There is no way I will be able to make a sharp turn at this speed.</p>
<p>	With no more warning, the freeway lane veers sharply to the left and directly in front of me sits a concrete barrier. I crank the wheel to the left in order to follow the path of the freeway, but the turn is too sharp, and I am traveling too fast. I feel the SUV tilt dangerously to one side, and I see the concrete of the ground through my side window grow closer as the vehicle crashes onto the driver's side.</p>
<p>	The window was open before my fall, but my seat belt restrains me from skidding onto the pavement. A horrendous sound of screeching metal fills my ears, then the front end of the SUV collides with a solid object and everything goes black.</p>
