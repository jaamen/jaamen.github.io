<h3> Chapter 7 </h3>
<p>I open my eyes, but immediately squint in the glare of the sun blazing down on me. A moment of disorientation washes over me. What happened to me? The memory of the previous night's events slowly comes back.</p>
<p>	After remembering being shot twice and stabbed the day before, I quickly check my wounds. The only one still bleeding is in my shoulder. The mud I compacted into the wound the night before stopped most of the blood loss, but I still feel weak. I need some type of medical attention or supplies, or I am not going to last much longer.</p>
<p>	I look around to get my bearings, and see the current carried me a good distance from where I fell into the river. The banks of the river rise up on both sides of me so I can not figure out my location. I must have traveled a long way downriver, because the skyscrapers and bridges of downtown are nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>	My progress down the river was halted by a group of tall rocks poking out of the river bed. I gasp in shock as I see I am not the only thing these rocks stopped from flowing down stream.</p>
<p>	An older man in khakis and a green shirt lies against the moss covered rocks. His only movements are caused by the current of the river rocking him back and forth. His glazed over eyes stare up into the bright blue sky.</p>
<p>	I splash over to his resting place and attempt to revive him, but it is no use. I should at least get him out of this river. I reach my arms under his shoulders in an attempt to carry him over to the bank when I hear shouts coming from downriver.</p>
<p>	Freezing, I wait. The voices are getting louder, and I realize they must be coming this way. I swiftly drag the man's body over to the bank to make sure he is clear of any water. I do not know if he is going to make it, but I do not want him to drown first if he has any chance of waking up.</p>
<p>	I crawl up into the thick grass that lines both sides of the river's banks to conceal my position. The grass in this area must be at least three feet deep, richly nourished by the river and rarely cut short by a mower.</p>
<p>	Slowly, I raise my head high enough in the grass to see the source of the shouts. A man dressed similar to the patrols I had seen the day before is slowly making his way toward me. Seeing motion on the other side of the river as well, I spot another soldier walking parallel to the patrol on my side of the river. They must be combing the river bed for something. Maybe people hiding out like me.</p>
<p>	Hoping the grass will be tall enough to hide me from their view, I lay as still as possible. Barely daring to breathe, I wait as the patrol on my side of the river draws within thirty feet of me. Suddenly I hear his gruff voice command, "I can see you! Come out from there slowly with your hands up!"</p>
<p>	My blood runs cold, and I have no idea what to do. Last time I tried to give myself up to these people they shot me and left me for dead. The fear of what might happen to me freezes my body into place, and I am unable to move.</p>
<p>	"Come out now or I will open fire!" the man commands a second time, only this time his voice rings with much more menace. I remain motionless, not only because I am unsure what to do, but also because I am paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>	"I will give you to the count of three to stand up," the soldier barks. "After I get to three, I am going to unload my entire clip of bullets into the area where I know you are lying. I have a thirty round clip in a fully automatic assault rifle. I do not know how smart you are, but I hope you can do the math. Give yourself up now so I do not have to waste my ammo."</p>
<p>	"One!" he shouts. My mind races trying to come up with some possible solution that does not either leave me shot to death or in this man's custody. I can not think of anything and time is running out fast.</p>
<p>	"Two!"</p>
<p>	I could just give myself up, but he will probably kill me anyway. I can not stay here because he will shoot me.</p>
<p>	The only way I might possibly have a chance enters my brain at the last second. If I roll away from him in the deep grass he might miss hitting me. After his gun is empty and he tries to reload, I can try and overtake him or scramble and get out of here. It is not a very good plan, but it is the best one I have.</p>
<p>	"Okay, you asked for it. Three!" The guard raises his assault rifle. I see his finger near the trigger, and I prepare myself to roll away through the tall grass hoping somehow that the spray of bullets might miss me.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, a man I had not seen pops out of the tall grass less than twenty feet away. He is wearing a black suit and seems very out of place in this area. The look on his face is one of pure terror.</p>
<p>	I thought the soldier had seen me and not some other person. I had no idea anyone else was out here. I have to stay hidden or the soldiers will shoot us both.</p>
<p>	"Why didn't you stand up the first time I asked you?" the patrol asks the man. With his hands raised in the air the man answers with fear in his voice, "I've seen what you monsters do to people. You are just going to drag me away to a prison like you did with all the other people from my office."</p>
<p>	The patrol walks over to the man and grabs one of his raised hands while still leveling the assault rifle at his chest. He lets go of the rifle, but the strap keeps it from falling to where I might have a chance of getting hold of it. The soldier uses a zip tie to secure the man's hands behind his back.</p>
<p>	The patrol yells over to his partner across the river, "Guess we should take this guy in, right?"</p>
<p>	 I silently breathe a sigh of relief. At least they are not going to kill him. From across the river I hear the other patrol's response.</p>
<p>	"We could, but then we would have to come back out here after taking him in. It would be just that much later we would be out tonight."</p>
<p>	The patrol on my side yells back across, "Then what should I do with him?"</p>
<p>	The other patrol responds, "Just kill him and leave him here. Who is going to know except you and me? Besides, Stefan and Rasputin do not care if people like this are alive or dead anyway."</p>
<p>	An icy chill runs down my spine as the man's eyes grow wide with horror. There is nothing I can do as the patrol's hand clamps over the man's mouth to stifle his scream. At the same time, a knife blade glints briefly in the sun before it plunges deep into the man's back.</p>
<p>	The ruthless soldier backs up a step and kicks his victim as hard as he can in the back sending him sailing down the bank and landing headfirst in the rocks jutting up out of the water of the river. That could have been me. It will be if I am spotted. I need to see if I can help the injured man, but for now I have to be careful and stay still unless I want to meet the same fate.</p>
<p>	"It's handled," the patrol on my side of the river yells to his cohort on the other side.</p>
<p>	"Nicely done, let's keep moving," the patrol on the opposite bank yells back.</p>
<p>	The soldier on my side of the river re-sheathes his knife and once again shoulders his assault rifle. He begins moving through the thick grass closer and closer to where I am laying. The man is so close to me I can hear his boots hit the earth. I hold my breath and look down in order to avoid him seeing the white of my eyes.</p>
<p>	Soaking in the muddy river overnight camouflaged my body and clothes fairly well. I hope it did a good enough job.</p>
<p>	The patrol swishes through the deep grass to within ten feet of me. The sound of his movement suddenly stops right next to me. My mind blanks with fear, and my heart is drumming in my chest. Why did he stop? Have I been spotted?</p>
<p>	"Hey, you want to grab a beer when we get back to base?" the patrol, less than five feet from me, yells across the river.</p>
<p>	"Sure, but you're buying," the other patrol replies. The swish of the grass resumes from the patrol's footsteps, and the sound eventually fades into the distance. I lay still for a while until I am sure they have had enough time to walk far away from me. Only after I am positive the patrol exited my area do I risk a peak over the grass.</p>
<p>	I can see no trace of anyone, so I hurry down to the final resting place of the stabbed man to see if I can help him in anyway. He looks as though he died either right after he was stabbed or right after he fell headfirst onto the rocks of the river.</p>
<p>	I realize there is nothing I can do for him except to say a quick prayer. Not wanting to have to witness any more death, I return to the deep grass and make my way to the top of the river bank. I climb to the top of the grassy hill and am greeted by a welcome sight.</p>
