<h3> Chapter 19 </h3>
<p>After walking a short distance, I notice movement between the densely packed trees. Two soldiers, wearing gear similar to what I just put on, walk toward me. Their boots crunch the dead sticks and leaves of the forest floor beneath them.</p>
<p>	Time to see if my disguise will actually work. The men signal at me to come over, and I prepare myself to fight if necessary. Hopefully, I can just talk to these guys a little and then be on my way, but I need to be ready for anything.</p>
<p>	I walk over to the men and pray that they have not seen pictures of me. I am banking on the fact that they are probably looking for anyone who is not wearing military gear in these woods. The drone that was watching me and the soldiers who almost shot me at the bank saw my civilian clothes. They do not know I changed outfits.</p>
<p>	Another thought hits me that almost stops my approach toward the other soldiers. What if they know Ramos and know that I am not him? It is too late to run now, they have spotted me. I will just have to play up my disguise and hope it works. If it does not, then once again I am going to have to fight my way out of bad situation.</p>
<p>	I stroll over to the two men, laying my hand casually onto the assault rifle hanging by a strap from my shoulder. I rest my finger very near to the trigger while trying not to let them see how nervous I am.</p>
<p>	When I come within a few yards of them, the soldier on the right says, "Hey, you seen anything out here?"</p>
<p>	I reply as relaxed as I can, "No, nothing. It is hard to spot anything in all these trees though." The name printed on his jacket is Michaels.</p>
<p>	"Ya, I know what you mean. We have been walking through this crap for an hour now. He isn't here, or he has a really good hiding spot," the man on the left says. His name tag says Stevenson.</p>
<p>	"Too bad we don't have that drone here, or we would be able to flush him out of any hiding spot easily with the thermal vision. Where is it anyway?" I ask the men.</p>
<p>	Repeating information I heard from the other soldiers will make me seem more like one of them. I might get some useful information as well, if I play my cards right.</p>
<p>	Stevenson replies, "It's flying over by the Bly-Tech factory. I guess some of the rebels tried to make a dash at the fences trying to free the prisoners. They didn't count on how much firepower we have already secured from the army reserve base in town. I just got radioed from HQ not too long ago that they are cleaning up over there. The drone should be back here soon after it flushes out a few more rebels. Then we can find this guy and get out of this damn forest."</p>
<p>	"Good thing, the fewer rebels the easier it will be for us," I lie, trying not to let my frustration be audible in my voice.</p>
<p>	As soon as the drone comes back, its thermal vision will spot the soldier I knocked out. When they find out it is not me hiding under that tree, and realize I am now wearing military garb, they will be after me. I have to shake these guys and get out of here as soon as possible.</p>
<p>	"Well, might as well keep looking in case we can find him before the drone does. Maybe a reward will be in store for the one who gets him first," I say in an attempt to detach from these men and escape.</p>
<p>	"Ya, if the higher-ups find out we are sitting around lolly gagging, we might get assigned guard duty at the factory. That place gives me the creeps with all the screaming coming out of the doctor's room. I was there only a few hours before I asked to be reassigned. Knowing he is torturing people in there was driving me crazy," says Michaels.</p>
<p>	Out of curiosity, and wondering what my fate could be if I am caught, I ask, "What do you think he does to them in there?"</p>
<p>	Michaels replies, "I don't know, but I have heard he is a collector of ancient torture devices. He probably uses them on his victims. I have seen people go in there kicking and screaming, and they come out completely changed. I even helped carry a few people into his office and strapped them to a table inside. Everyone I carried in walked out of their own accord and seemed sympathetic to our cause even though they went in against their own free will. Its the strangest thing. They go in hating us and come out a few hours later acting like we are their best friends. I don't know what he does in there, but it has to be real bad to change people like that."</p>
<p>	"Alright, let's try to avoid becoming one of his patients, I am going to go look some more over there," I say and point into the distance. I begin to walk away.</p>
<p>	"Later," both Stevenson and Michaels say in unison and walk in the other direction.</p>
<p>	I breath a sigh of relief. I can not believe I just got away with that. My heart pumps like crazy in my chest as I walk through the forest. While moving through the trees, I plan my next move.</p>
<p>	I could find a way out of the city and try to make it to another town. I do not know if the whole country got hit, but according to that news report I saw earlier, it seems to be isolated to this city for now.</p>
<p>	I can not leave though. These are people I know. People I work with, people I go to school with, and people I could run into all the time. They are being subjected to forced labor and most likely torture at this factory. I have a chance to do something about it, even though it is a small one. I need to try and link up with the other rebels. There might be some of them left near the factory that soldier mentioned. That is where I will go.</p>
<p>	After walking a ways, hoping to see daylight ahead letting me know I have reached the edge of the trees, I once again see movement in the distance. A soldier is yelling and waving at me to turn around and go the other way.</p>
<p>	"We found him! The drone spotted him hiding under a tree using the thermal vision. Turn around, they just radioed me where he is!" The soldier yells to me, "Lets go get 'em!"</p>
<p>	"Okay, I will follow you. I must have lost my radio back there," I say to the man. A radio. I must have missed that when taking Ramos' gear from him.</p>
<p>	I turn as if to follow the man, but let him run past me. I stay behind him for a while, then run in a different direction from the one he is going. He seems very focused on his path, and does not notice me slip away. As soon as he is out of sight, I sprint away from the area, trying to put as much distance between me and all the soldiers converging on the man they think is me.</p>
<p>	Once they realize he is missing his gear, they are going to be very suspicious of everyone in uniform. My disguise is not going to be very effective after that. They will radio all of the soldiers in the area to watch out for an impostor. I have to get out of these trees and out of this area as soon as possible.</p>
<p>	Up ahead, I finally see light streaming in between the tree trunks. I realize the edge of the forest is near, and I have no idea what kind of resistance they are going to have outside of the trees. I pray that they have not already found the nearly naked soldier and sent out an alert to watch for someone dressed in military fatigues who should not be.</p>
<p>	I push the last couple of branches out of my way and emerge from the forest. The sunlight cascading over the knee high grass is so bright compared to the dimness of the forest it hurts my eyes and takes a few seconds to adjust.</p>
<p>	I wish I had time to take a moment and wait in the forest to see what was out here before barging out, but I do not have time for that luxury. If I am going to make it past the forest perimeter defenses before they are on to me and my disguise, I have to keep moving. As soon as my eyes adjust to the glare, and I see what is in front of me, I almost dive back into the relative safety of the trees.</p>
