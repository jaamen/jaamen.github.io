<h3> Chapter 2 </h3>
<p>Eight police officers entered the restaurant. The majority of the officers remained in the main dining room, but a few ran into the kitchen and another two ran to check the bathrooms. One of the officers in the dining room shouted "Clear!" which was repeated by the men in the kitchen and the bathrooms.</p>
<p>Immediately after, a policeman who looked more in charge than the rest walked into the restaurant. He said, "You can all relax. The threat is long gone by now. We are going to be taking statements from everyone, and no one can leave until we get a full picture of what happened here."</p>
<p>	I came out slowly from underneath the table as people throughout the restaurant began nervously milling around. Most of them had shocked looks on their faces, and a few were sobbing because of the grisly sight they had witnessed.</p>
<p>	Several people were taken aside by the police to give their statements. After waiting a while, an officer walked up to me and reached out his hand.</p>
<p>	“Hello, my name is officer Callahan," he said, "I am going to ask you some questions about the incident, and I want you to answer as truthfully as possible. First, I am going to need your personal information.”</p>
<p>	I handed him my driver's license, and he jotted down my name, address, and driver's license number. After this, he said to me, “Okay,...Mark," he said, pausing for a second to double check the name on my driver's license, "What did you see?”</p>
<p>	I was still so excited and had so much to say at once my response all came out at the same time in a jumble. Callahan looked puzzled and then said, “Why don't you calm down a bit, take a deep breath and try that again, son?”</p>
<p>	I breathed in deep and then exhaled. After feeling my nerves relax a bit, I spoke again in a much more even tone. “Sorry, I guess I was just a little bit shocked by this whole situation."</p>
<p>	Callahan nodded his head, encouraging me to continue. "I was just sitting and eating while studying by myself at that table when I heard a bullet whiz through those plants. I saw it hit that man. I had looked up from the papers I was reading to see the bullet hit his face. Then I ducked under my table, but I got a glimpse of the man with the gun get into a waiting black SUV that sped off.”</p>
<p>	Callahan then asked, “Describe to me what the shooter looked like.” I told him, “He had on blue jeans and a gray jacket. He was wearing a black stocking hat, and his face was clean shaven. He was about medium height and build. There was nothing distinguishing or unique about him as far as I could tell."</p>
<p>	“Were there license plates on the vehicle?”</p>
<p>	“No, and the windows were tinted so I couldn't see anything inside."</p>
<p>	"You said earlier you heard the bullet pass through the plants, so does that mean you didn't hear the sound of the gun going off?"</p>
<p>	I had not really thought about that fact until Officer Callahan mentioned it to me. The only sound in the restaurant before the bullet traveled through the plants had been the bustle and chatter normally heard when people eat.</p>
<p>	I was thinking about one of the concepts for my upcoming physics test while staring off into space when I saw the bullet hit the man's body at the same time I heard it rustle the fake plants.</p>
<p>	"I guess that's right. It might seem weird, but I don't remember hearing anything like the sound of a gun going off," I said.</p>
<p>	"Just hold tight, I'll be right back," Callahan said, and he approached two other officers. They compared the statements they had just taken from the other people in the restaurant. I saw them exchange a few words, then Callahan nodded his head and walked back to where I was standing.</p>
<p>	"Your statement matches those of the other patrons. We think the shooter probably used some type of silencer or suppressor to muffle the sound of the shot. That would explain why you didn't actually hear the gun go off when it did."</p>
<p>	I nodded in understanding.</p>
<p>	Callahan continued, "You are free to go after picking up your things from the officer over there. If you would like counseling or need any information you can call us. Here's a card. If we need anything more from you, we know where to contact you," Callahan said as he handed me a business card with his information on it.</p>
<p>	I stuck it in my pocket in case I would need it later. </p>
<p>	Seeing the officer Callahan had specified, I went over to retrieve my things. I grabbed my notes and my backpack from him. When the officer offered me the half-eaten remains of the burrito I had been eating before the mayhem, I told him, "You can pitch it. I don't have much of an appetite anymore. Thanks, though."</p>
<p>	He grunted in understanding and tossed my leftovers into the trash.</p>
<p>	I walked toward the exit and glanced one more time back towards the blood smeared table. The paramedics were attending to the murdered man as they strapped his body onto the gurney. Suddenly, another man in a suit, oddly similar to the one the victim was wearing, walked up to where the paramedics were standing.</p>
<p>	This man wore dark sunglasses and did not remove them even in the dimly lit restaurant. He casually reached down and snatched the briefcase speckled with blood droplets sitting next to the victim's table. One of the police officers spotted the man in the suit and walked up shaking his head with his hand held out.</p>
<p>	“What do you think you are doing? This is a crime scene and that's evidence! Put it down now!" The shouting officer began pulling his handgun out of its holster.</p>
<p>	I could almost feel the man in the suit staring in contempt at the police officer. He pulled a badge from his suit pocket and flipped it open. From where I was standing, I could just barely catch a glimpse of three letters with dots in between.</p>
<p>	He then said to the officer, "Relax, the content of this briefcase is federal property. If it can be of assistance to your investigation of the murder, send us a request for it later."</p>
<p>	My mind reeled as I thought of the possibilities. This was most likely not a random killing and a government agency was involved.</p>
<p>	Without another word, the government man carried the briefcase past the stunned officer, and then me. He walked importantly out the door without another look back.</p>
<p>	As I left the restaurant, an officer standing outside smoking a cigarette looked at me and said sarcastically, "Have a nice day."</p>
<p>	Disgusted, I walked away without giving the man a reply. Then I got into my car and drove home.</p>
