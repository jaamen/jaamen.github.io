I saw a man die today. I heard the bullet rip through the plastic decorative ferns of the restaurant and watched it connect in a bloody spray with his forehead. The calm atmosphere of the restaurant was shattered, and chaos filled the air. Patrons ran in every direction, none certain where the bullet had originated. The regular murmur of personal conversations was replaced by screams.
	As soon as the shot rang out, and I recovered from the initial shock, I scrambled under my table.  My heart was beating so fast, I thought it might burst from my chest. I had never felt such fear before. After waiting a few moments and hearing no more gunfire, I slowly stuck my head out from my hiding place. The other people in the restaurant did the same, and we all looked at one another in stunned disbelief.
	We were in a restaurant where the walls were windows stretching from floor to ceiling. The bullet had shattered one of the windows leaving a gaping hole surrounded by jagged broken glass. I barely caught sight of the man who must have fired the shot as he jumped in a black SUV with tinted windows. The vehicle's tires threw up gravel as the SUV sped out of the parking lot at a dangerous rate of speed.
	The next thing that drew my immediate attention was the injured man sitting three table away from me. He was wearing a black suit and tie covered in blood and gore. The man's head was lying face down on the table.
	Shock slowly spread over me as I realized I had never watched anyone die. I had been to funerals, but actually watching someone's life drain out of them in a red pool on the floor is much different.
	Not knowing what to do, I stayed crouched under the table. Someone yelled, “Call 911!" Another yelled, “Check if he is still breathing!”
	Others just sobbed or stared as blankly as I did. I do not like to admit it, but I froze and could not move.
	Before this incident, I had always liked to think I would be the guy who stands up and takes charge of the situation. I definitely did not want to be one of the timid people hiding under the table, but that is who I was.
	I was scared out of my mind and still shaking from the adrenaline. Two minutes ago, I was studying for a physics test and eating a burrito. Next thing I know, I was crouched under a table trying not to vomit, because I just saw a man take a bullet to his head.
	Employees of the restaurant and a few other brave souls eventually ran up to the man. I still could not move. An employee said, "Is anyone here a doctor?" She was only met with silence.
	After a few minutes, an older man with thinning gray hair and a beard raised his hand and said, "I'm not a doctor, but I am trained in CPR. I do not know how much I can help, but I can try."
	The older gentleman picked up the wounded man's hand and said, “I don't feel a pulse. I can try and give him CPR, until paramedics arrive.”
	He gingerly moved the man's head back in order to get him in a position to give CPR, but almost instantly let him drop back onto the blood-soaked table. A look of horror and disgust was written clearly on his face. 
	“Oh my God, he was shot in the face.” The old man put his hands over his own face in an attempt to block out the mental image he had just received, but the damage was already done. He broke down and fell to his knees in front of everyone.
	Some of the people tried to console him, telling him there was nothing he could have done, but he just kept repeating over and over to himself, “He was shot in the face. He was shot in the face.” All the other people who had gone over to the wounded man lost their nerve, and they just milled around, unsure what to do.
	Finally, the manager of the restaurant got up on one of the seats and yelled, “Everyone listen up!” Except for a few occasional sobs, the restaurant fell into complete silence. All of us were relieved someone else had taken charge.
	The manager continued, “The police and paramedics have been contacted and are on their way. Everyone should just get comfortable and stay put for a while, because the police will want statements from everyone. I'm sorry if you have somewhere to be, but for now, no one is allowed to leave. Thank you for your cooperation.”
	As he stepped down off of his chair, sirens blared in the distance. They grew louder by the second until squad cars and an ambulance could be seen pulling into the parking lot outside. The police jumped from their cruisers with their weapons drawn as the paramedics exited the rear of the ambulance and prepared a stretcher.
	The police stormed into the restaurant pointing their weapons at us, yelling “Everybody down! Nobody move! Slowly put your hands behind your heads!”
