<h2> The Hunt for the Treasure! </h2>
<p> For those of you who enjoy puzzles, have I got something cool for you! If you don't like puzzles, then just enjoy the 
free book. But if you do, hidden in the pages of this book is the name of another popular book published a few years ago
that happens to be one of my favorites. If you can figure out the name of this book and email it to me, I will provide you with
the next clue!</p>

<p> If you are the first person to decipher all of the clues, you will be given a monetary reward of at least $100, deposited into
a PayPal account of your choosing. If this book and website become a success, which I hope they will, and ten percent of the money
that I make equals more than $100, the winner will get that amount instead!</p>

<p> I will have a number of hints available for all the treasure seekers. As I receive enough likes or follows on my social
media pages, I will add more hints until the first clue is solved. I will give any person who solves the clue on their own a head
start before posting the answer to the first clue and the second clue on the website. This makes sharing the website and book
with friends a double-edge sword, since more people will be hunting for the answers to the clues, but more hints will also
be unlocked!</p>

<h4> Hints </h4>
<h5> -The entire first clue is located in the same chapter.</h5>
