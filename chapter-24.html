<h3> Chapter 24 </h3>
<p>Continuing past the staircase, I find the upper level of the freight elevator I had seen on the lower floor. I push the button for level one, which will take it to the floor crawling with soldiers. Directly below the button for the loading zone is a button marked "Basement." This button has a key slot beside it. I am going to have to find that key if I am going to destroy this factory.</p>
<p>After pressing the level one button, I run out and the doors slide closed behind me, leaving me on the second floor. Running back to the door at the top of the staircase, I open it with my pistol raised in case some unlucky soldier decided to choose this moment to come up.</p>
<p>	The staircase is deserted, and I take the stairs a couple at a time in an attempt to beat the elevator to the bottom floor. My heart pounding, I reach the door leading into the shipping zone. Slowly I pull the handle of the door and open it less than an inch.</p>
<p>	Through the tiny slit, I can make out a large group of soldiers suddenly coming alert and staring puzzled at the elevator. Just as I thought. No one is supposed to use that elevator from the upper floors without the soldiers in the loading dock knowing about it.</p>
<p>	While the soldiers are distracted, I swiftly open the door and run behind a pile of boxes sitting a short way in front of me. The access to the stairs is far enough from the elevator doors that no one notices me. The slow freight elevator doors are still shut, but the whir of the elevator gears is distinctly audible. After a few more seconds, I hear them grind to a halt.</p>
<p>	With a ding that echos in the quiet space of the shipping floor, the doors of the elevator slide open. The front few soldiers nervously bring the ends of their guns up, ready to shoot any threat that should emerge. Once the soldiers see that the elevator is empty, most of the men lower their weapons and begin joking with one another about being too jumpy.</p>
<p>	A couple of the soldiers move into the elevator and push the button to ride it up, most likely to check and see if there is anything suspicious on the other floors. I will be in trouble if they decide to investigate into the clean rooms.</p>
<p>	When none of the guards are looking, I move into the hallway leading to the Doctor's office. Quietly opening the door, I re-enter the maintenance closet.</p>
<p>	The soldier I shot in the leg earlier looks up at me in surprise as I enter the room. He looks much paler than the last time I saw him, but after quickly checking his wound it seems the tourniquet and gauze stopped most of the bleeding. I am no expert on this, but I think he will live. I remove his gag, and he spits onto the floor.</p>
<p>	"Are you here to finish me off?" he says in a defiant voice.</p>
<p>	"No, I am here because I need your help and you need mine," I reply to him.</p>
<p>	"You won't get any help from me. You shot me!" he says.</p>
<p>	"Only because you threw a knife at me first. I am going to destroy this factory. If you don't help me, I will leave you here for the place to come crashing down on your head. If you do help me, I will untie you and give you enough time to get out of the factory before I blow it up," I say to him.</p>
<p>	At my words, his eyes grow wide with fear. In a near panicked voice, he says, "Okay, what do you need? I will help you, but you have to let me go. I don't want to die here."</p>
<p>	"I need a key to the basement. I am guessing you know where it is, considering your post was right outside of the maintenance closet," I say, hoping I am right.</p>
<p>	He says, "It's right here on my belt. The one with the round head. Put it in the elevator and turn it, and it should give you access to the basement. Now please, let me go."</p>
<p>	I move over to the handcuffs holding the man to the pipe. Using the keys I took from him in our first encounter, I unlock the cuffs. The soldier staggers to his feet, limping because of the bullet wound in his knee. He rubs his wrists where his binds had dug in. He is too weak from the bullet wound to try and attack me.</p>
<p>	I need to make sure he does not alert the other soldiers too soon. Thinking fast, I tell him, "A group of hostages are free and moving around the factory with assault rifles. They will not hesitate to kill the people who took them away from their families, and they are gunning down every soldier in this factory they see. Do not go to the shipping floor if you want to make it out of here alive, that is the first place they will go. Is there another way you can get out?"</p>
<p>	Believing my story and knowing he would not stand much chance unarmed and with an injured leg, the man nods his head in assent.</p>
<p>	"Then go there as fast as you can and move into the forest with your hands raised in the air. The resistance fighters outside are much more forgiving than the people in here. They are shooting on sight," I say to the soldier.</p>
<p>	I know it is a lie, the hostages I freed are not even going to the loading zone, but I can not have this man alerting the soldiers there before I make it into the basement.</p>
<p>	Gesturing with my pistol, I let the man know he is free to go. Before he limps away, the wounded soldier turns to me and says, "Thank you for sparing my life. I probably would have killed you if I had gotten the chance. You are a better man than me. I never should have gotten mixed up with Stefan and Rasputin."</p>
<p>	After making it out the door, the man heads away from the shipping zone. It really payed off to keep that soldier alive. I do not know how I would have found the maintenance key without his help. With the key in hand, I move back into the hallway, closing the door of the maintenance closet behind me. Now, I need to burn this place to the ground.</p>
