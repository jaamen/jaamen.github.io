<h3> Chapter 26 </h3>
<p>Right as the doors close, there is a massive decompression as the caged oxygen is let free into the basement. A millisecond later there is an explosion and a roar from the oxygen catching fire. The elevator shakes, but continues to rise to the second floor. I can picture the flames filling up the basement below me. The elevator begin to become really warm.</p>
<p>	Once the doors open to the empty second floor hallway, I begin to run down the hall as fast as I am able in the same direction that the freed hostages traveled. As soon as I am out of the elevator, I notice flames coming up through the floor of the elevator shaft.</p>
<p>	They were going outside to free the other hostages, so there has to be a way out this direction. Hopefully, they got the hostages out and did not get themselves killed in the process.</p>
<p>	While running down the hallway as fast as my injured body will carry me, I try to think about how long it will take for the factory to completely destruct. I hope this place holds together until I get out of here.</p>
<p>	Dashing down the hallway, the doors and branches wiz past me. I have to get farther away from the clean rooms with their direct link to the oxygen in the basement. They will probably start spewing flames any second.</p>
<p>	More hallways and more doors fly by in a whir. How many clean rooms does this place have? The splitter downstairs only had six branches, but there must be more splitters down the road from the six main ones.</p>
<p>	The end of the hallway looms up in front of me. There is a door cracked slightly open ahead. Through the crack I can see daylight. Maybe Steve and the other freed hostages left it open when they went to help the others escape. I run headlong into the door, shoving it wide open. I am temporarily blinded by the bright midday sun, but have no time get my bearings.</p>
<p>	The second I open the door, an earth shaking rumble erupts from the depths of the factory. I turn to see flames shoot out of the large picture windows of the clean rooms, sending flying shards of glass into the walls opposite them. Glad I made it out of the hallway. I slam the door shut to prevent any of the glass from cutting me.</p>
<p>	It seems like my method of destruction should be effective, but I have to get away from this factory before it comes down on top of me.</p>
<p>	My eyes finally adjust to the brightness of outside, and I see that I am standing on a metal staircase leading to the ground. The area around the stairs stretches about half the length of a football field and is surrounded by a chain link fence topped with razor wire. A bunch of shipping containers lie on the ground, most of them open.</p>
<p>	The area seems deserted. This looks like the area Steve described where the soldiers were holding the hostages. If so, it looks like he was able to get them to safety. A great sense of relief washes over me, but another explosion serves as a reminder that I now need to save myself. I have to get clear of this building.</p>
<p>	I start running down the stairs as fast as possible. Bounding down the steps two or three at a time, I feel the air grow distinctly warmer. I hear the sound of commotion from afar and see groups of soldiers running out of the building as flames follow behind them.</p>
<p>	The majority of the fleeing soldiers seem very disoriented and half do not look like they even remembered to bring their weapons with them. I am sure if there are any resistance fighters left in the forest, they will easily be able to mop up these soldiers now that they do not have a building to hide inside.</p>
<p>	After making it down the first of four flights of stairs, the door I recently exited bursts from it hinges and flies out onto the staircase above in a blast of flame. An intense heat envelopes me for a few seconds, and I begin to drip with sweat. The heat subsides the farther I get away from the top floor, but is still intense. Flames leap out of the empty door frame above me, and red and orange streaks of fire lick up the side of the building to the roof.</p>
<p>	Practically leaping down the last flight of stairs, I hit the ground running. A chain link gate large  enough for a car to drive through swings on its hinges past the empty storage containers. I make my way toward the open gate sprinting as fast as I can, even though I am panting to catch my breath and a stitch of pain shoots through my side from exertion.</p>
<p>	Looking back at the factory, I see the entire structure is now engulfed in flames that shoot far up into the sky. The fire from the building still heats the air even though I am now outside the fence and running across an empty field to reach the woods.</p>
<p>	Only after I hit the tree line do I allow myself to relax. I fall to the ground exhausted, gasping for breath. I must have been making quite a lot of noise, because I do not hear the sound of someone approaching. Suddenly, the sound of a weapon cocking breaks the stillness of the forest, and I hear a voice say, "Let me see your hands or I will shoot!"</p>
