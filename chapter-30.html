<h3> Chapter 30 </h3>
<p>I approach the elevators and use my borrowed security card to open the doors. The inside is all stainless steel walls except for a mirror on one side. I look like hell. My bruised and battered body stares back at me, and all that I have been through in the past days feels unreal.</p>
<p>Pushing the highest numbered button on the panel, I watch the numbers of the elevator climb steadily higher. I radio John now that I am relatively safe. "John, whats your status?" I say into my radio.</p>
<p>	John answers,"Glad to hear from you. That means you are safe so far. I made it to one of the upper floors of the Atlantic Union Insurance building. It is only a block away from the Bank Tower. The revolving doors out front were unlocked, and I found a spot with a great view of your building. A bunch of the windows in here were already blown out, so I can fire freely without drawing attention to myself. I shot a few rounds at the vehicles sitting around the security fence to catch the attention of some of the guards to pull them away from the tower. How are you doing in there?"</p>
<p>	I reply, "Great. I am riding the elevator up to the top floor. If I can find Rasputin, then I think I will have a better chance of saving our friends."</p>
<p>	John says, "If you want sniper cover from me, stay on the north side of the building. I can see into the building, but only so far."</p>
<p>	"Okay, I will try and keep you posted with my position if I need any help. Over and out," I say as the floor numbers catch my eye. The floor I want to reach is the fiftieth, but the changing numbers begin to slow down only a little over halfway there.</p>
<p>	I feel the swift elevator come to a halt. The red digital numbers remain motionless on thirty-seven. Suddenly, the doors slide open and two soldiers are talking to one another right in front of me. Both are heavily armed.</p>
<p>	The two men face one another and are so absorbed in their conversation, they do not realize that anyone is inside the elevator. One of the men says to the other, "The elevator is here, but let's wait for Dave. He can come with us this time. I can't believe the security office's communications went dark again. There have been so many problems setting up our comms in this place, I have no idea why Rasputin chose it."</p>
<p>	The other man replies, "He wanted to be on top of the city and with its built in lockdown system, this was the best place to do that."</p>
<p>	The man who spoke second begins to turn towards the elevator. Before he see me, I gain as much forward momentum as possible, and I tackle the two men into the wall. We go down in a heap, but I come up on top.</p>
<p>	I spring to my feet faster than the soldiers and kick their weapons away from their grasp. I level my weapon at them, and they both raise their hands in the air. Using the end of my weapon, I motion for them to get into the elevator. They quickly comply. I relieve them of their radios so they are unable to call for help.</p>
<p>	I reach around the corner and push as many of the buttons for the higher floors as I can, then wait for the doors to shut. The elevator will stop on all of those floors, preventing them from coming back to this one for a while.</p>
<p>	As the whir of the engine inside the elevator begins, I see another soldier walking toward me in the reflection of a brass decorative flower pot sitting on the receptionist's desk. I move the other direction down the hall toward a row of cubicles and duck inside one of them.</p>
<p>	After waiting for a few seconds, I chance a look. The man is obviously confused and seems angry that his compatriots told him to show up at the elevator and then left without him. This must be Dave. Luckily for me, the assault rifles I kicked away from the soldiers went under a desk and are out of sight. Dave enters the other elevator and disappears from sight.</p>
<p>	I need to move fast. Those men I sent away in the elevator could find a way to alert the other guards on this floor any second. Using the elevator is too risky now. There has to be a staircase to the top floor in case of any emergencies that would shut down the elevator. I need to find it.</p>
<p>	Peering out from the cubicle I am hiding inside, I can only see row upon row of more cubicles identical to mine. All of them look bare and utilitarian with only the occasional personal item posted on the wall or sitting on top of the cubicle dividers.</p>
<p>	Windows looking on the outside world stretch from floor to ceiling on every wall except for the white wall of the central core that contains the elevators. The elevators are in a hallway that cuts through the middle of the core and links two areas filled with cubicles on either side.</p>
<p>	Making sure the area is clear, I move from my hiding spot, staying low so no one who is standing upright and looking across the dividers of the cubicles would be able to see me. The core of the building on this side is an unbroken white wall except for the hallway with the elevator.</p>
<p>	The staircase door must be on the other side of the core. I have to get over there, but going back through the elevator hallway would leave me too exposed. There has to be another way to get over there. Maybe I can go around the ends of the core.</p>
<p>	I keep moving toward the back of the building until I run out of cubicles. There is an open space before me, and then a row of office doors line the back wall. A ten foot wide open hallway sits between the wall of the core and the office doors. I can see the other set of cubicles down the hallway.</p>
<p>	All of the solid oak office doors are shut. I have no idea if any of these offices are occupied or not, but I am not going to throw open any doors and take that chance. This means I will be without cover until I can make it past the hallway to the other cubicles.</p>
<p>	Raising my head enough to see above the dividers, I count twelve soldiers milling around the area. There are probably just as many on the other side. I wait until none of them are looking in my direction, then I leave the safety of the cubicles. Moving as fast as I can while crouched, I make it into the hallway.</p>
<p>	The white wall of the core is flat and featureless on this side as well, and does not contain the staircase door. I move along the wall opposite the office doors and approach the corner leading to the other set of cubicles. Without warning, a door opens directly in front of me and a fully armed soldier steps into the hall.</p>
<p>	We are both surprised, and I raise my assault rifle as he fumbles for his. Thankfully, I am faster. The assault rifle springs to life in my hands and the man goes down in a burst of gunfire. He is wearing full body armor that should stop most of the bullets from penetrating his skin, but he falls to the floor and remains motionless.</p>
<p>	Before the door he opened closes automatically behind him, I notice a group of cots in the room. They must be using these offices like barracks for the soldiers on some of the floors. I do not have much time to think about this further, because I hear shouts and men approaching my position.</p>
<p>	They heard the gunfire and are coming to get me. I can not go back, I have to keep pushing forward. I need to find that stairwell if I want to save my friends.</p>
<p>	I jump out sideways from the hallway and aim my body to land behind of a row of cubicles. In mid-air, I point my gun in front of me and fire as soon as I see movement. Five soldiers are running down the hall toward me, and my gunfire brings the first one to the floor.</p>
<p>	The men behind him raise their weapons, and the explosive sound of multiple assault rifles firing fills the air. I land on the carpet and watch bullet holes appear on an office door behind the space I just left.</p>
<p>	As soon as the gunfire ceases, I spring up from behind the cubicles until I am able to look out over them. I fire my weapon over the beige dividers at the men and watch two go down. The rest duck for cover and disappear from sight. Immediately, I crouch down and begin moving swiftly to a new position before they get a chance to converge on me.</p>
<p>	Staying low, I move farther down the hall created by the cubicle dividers and the large glass windows. After traveling for about twenty feet, I pop up once again to unleash a salvo of bullets at my attackers. Another one collapses, but the rest are more prepared for me this time. Almost as soon as I go up, they fire back.</p>
<p>	I quickly fall to the floor to get out of the way of their bullets, but the only thing behind me is the glass wall separating all of us from the outside elements. The glass cracks from the first few bullets, then shatters completely after a few more. Shards of broken glass fall all around me as I lay on the gray carpet. The wind whips through the open gap in the building, sending stacks of papers flying through the air. I use the opportunity to once again change my position and move farther down the hall.</p>
<p>	Raising up to see the new position of my attackers, I am greeted with a burst of gunfire almost immediately. The glass behind me shatters, and I duck my head to shield myself from the broken shards once again. A strange thud a few feet away from me catches my attention. Looking for its source, I find that a  grenade sits on the floor next to me just out of my reach.</p>
<p>	That does not look anything like the stun grenade I used earlier. This grenade looks more like the ones I used to blow up that SUV a few days ago, meaning it will be much more deadly. I do not know how long I have until the grenade explodes, but I know time is short.</p>
<p>	I am lying right next to the broken window and look out to the dizzying depths below. Then I roll my body off of the carpet, out the window, and into the open air. Wind rushes past me as the grenade explodes, sending a small fireball out the window I just left.</p>
