<h3> Chapter 3 </h3>
<p>A few hours later, I am sitting in my one bedroom, third floor apartment rethinking all that happened earlier. I have all my papers for an upcoming college physics test in front of me, but am unable to focus.</p>
<p>	The television is playing a game show in front of me while I wait for the news to come on. I want to see if there is any more information about the incident at the restaurant. A bowl of stale cereal sits in front of me getting soggier by the second.</p>
<p>	My appetite had slowly regained since the events earlier, but I am still not feeling very hungry. I do not know if I will ever be able to eat a burrito again.</p>
<p>	As I am about to take another bite of cereal the news comes on. A soggy mass of the cereal drops onto the sweat pants I put on after getting home from the restaurant. I absentmindedly brush it off, quickly checking to make sure it does not leave a stain.</p>
<p>	That is one good thing about buying this bland, healthy, all-natural cereal; it has no artificial dyes to leave stains.</p>
<p>	I had been trying to eat healthier over the last year. I had started out quite a few pounds overweight, but had lost most of the excess fat. Hitting the gym a few times a week helped a lot as well.</p>
<p>	I assumed the motivation to work out started from my ostracization in high school. I was overweight, shy, and did not have very many friends during my high school years. The other kids also thought I was odd, because both of my parents had abandoned me when I was very young. My grandparents had raised me from the age of two.</p>
<p>	Being different than the other kids in high school does not usually lead to very good outcomes, and it was no different in my case.</p>
<p>	I focused more on my schoolwork and getting good grades than trying to be successful socially. Being successful on tests and other schoolwork helped me feel good about myself, and helped me keep my mind off the fact that the other students treated me like an outcast.</p>
<p>	I did not have much luck with girls, and the friends who I did have in high school did not end up going to college in the same city as I did, so I became somewhat of a loner.</p>
<p>	Freshman year of college, I devoted myself to getting in better shape, thinking that once the weight was off, more people would gravitate towards me and my social awkwardness would disappear.</p>
<p>	Having achieved my goals of weight loss after a year of hard work, I found that I was still lonely. I was in my sophomore year of college now, and knew that if I was ever going to be happy with my life, I was going to have to put myself out there and try to make some friends. My goal for the year was to become much less introverted than I had been in the past, but it has not been easy.</p>
<p>	After the intro music ends, the news anchor begins talking about the big political stories of the day.</p>
<p>	The news is not positive. Congress has once again failed to pass a proposed bill. Lately, nearly every bill had been decisively shot down. Even laws and changes seen as a win-win by most of the public were killed due to the bickering of the political parties.</p>
<p>	I do not follow politics too closely, but I know that the majority of Americans are fed up with the inaction of this government. The approval rating of this Congress is hovering around five percent, and might go even lower.</p>
<p>	The government had better figure out a way to stop arguing and get something done, or this country is going to have bigger problems than it already does very soon.</p>
<p>	The only really important law that had been passed lately was the Hyde Bill. This law was passed in reaction to President McDonald sending troops to a third world country without Congressional approval.</p>
<p>	After the invasion, the move was seen by most as negative, and Congress would have never agreed to send troops when it finally came to a decision.</p>
<p>	Supposedly, President McDonald had proof that human rights violations were taking place in a small African country. After US troops invaded, no human rights violations were found, and the president was accused of only invading to further the interests of his business friends. None of it was proven, but he raised the ire of Congress enough that they chose to do something about it.</p>
<p>	Congress argued that if McDonald had waited for congressional approval, the US could have saved countless lives and the embarrassment of our nation. A Congressman whose last name was Hyde proposed a bill that restricted any type of military intervention unless Congress approved it first.</p>
<p>	To the nations surprise, after Congress had struck down nearly every bill it had seen, the Hyde Bill sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate and was made into law with an ease most people did not  expect.</p>
<p>	After the national news ends, there is a story much closer to home. Our very own city of Bakersville will be hosting a financial summit for the members of Congress. It is being hailed, at least locally, as the biggest Congressional meet-up outside of Washington.</p>
<p>	The whole city is gearing up for the meeting that is only a few days away. The city of Bakersville did so well during the latest depression, that the city was awarded the opportunity to teach Congress about some of the financial things that they did right. Most people were unsure how much Congress would actually listen, but the city was excited because the summit would bring in a lot of extra revenue.</p>
<p>	Congress is set to take a break tomorrow, and many of its members will begin arriving in Bakersville in the next few days for the week long summit. About half of the members from the Senate and House are expected to come for this summit that is expected to be a breakthrough because of its bipartisanship.</p>
<p>	After this, there was a community improvement story, and then the anchors begin talking about the local murders, robberies, and accidents. I sit closer to the TV waiting to hear the story about the murder I personally witnessed. I was curious if they were going to release more details about the victim or the gunman.</p>
<p>	The female anchor talks about a shooting in the northern part of the city, then a robbery of a convenience store. The shooting at the restaurant is not mentioned and after a few more unrelated stories, the news hour is over.</p>
<p>	As the credits begin rolling I look at the TV perplexed. A thousand thoughts go through my head at once.</p>
<p>	It definitely happened early enough in the day to make the nightly news. Why was it not on? Does it have something to do with the fact that the victim was working for the government? Was I a witness to some type of government coverup?</p>
<p>	I do not really know what to think about the whole situation. I begin to feel exhaustion creeping in as the next show begins playing, and I decide to go to bed. I have to work at seven in the morning, so mulling it over will have to wait until later. I have to pay the bills and my way through school somehow.</p>
<p>	I stand up and head to the bathroom.</p>
<p>	As I brush my teeth, I look into the mirror. I rub my hand over my week old stubble. I wonder if I should shave tonight, or should I just wait until the morning? I suppose I should shave sometime soon.</p>
<p>	A loud knock at the door brings me back from my thoughts.</p>
