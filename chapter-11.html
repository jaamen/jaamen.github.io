<h3> Chapter 11 </h3>
<p>From underneath the SUV, I see all of the the men except one enter the grocery store through the shattered glass door. The one man remaining by the door is looking into the building with his back to me. I guess none of them thought I could have made it outside already.</p>
<p>	I crawl out from underneath the vehicle on the side farther from the glass door. Slowly lifting my head, I raise it until I can see in through the passenger side window. The keys to the vehicle are dangling from the ignition. Thank God, I finally caught a break.</p>
<p>	Gently popping the door latch, I try to be as quiet as possible. The slight click sounds terribly loud in the eerily quiet city, but the soldier by the door does not notice. I inch the door open until there is just enough space for me to climb into the passenger side of the vehicle.</p>
<p>	Waiting outside of the SUV for a few seconds, I watch the soldier guarding the door through the driver side window. His back is turned to me and he stares intently into the grocery store. The man shuffles slightly and then looks back towards the two vehicles.</p>
<p>	I freeze as he scans the parking lot for signs of movement. Please do not notice the door of the SUV is open. The man's eyes rest on the SUV for an uncomfortably long period of time, before a sudden noise in the store bring the man's attention back to the inside of the building. I catch a glimpse of one of the soldier teams reaching the end of an aisle and then heading down the next one.</p>
<p>	Laying my rifle on the floor of the SUV, I climb up into the passenger seat. I stay as low as I possibly can in case the sentry turns around again. I have to do this quickly. Okay, 1...2...3, go! As gracefully as I possibly can in the confined space of the vehicle I scramble from the passenger seat to the drivers seat, slamming the passenger door shut in the process.</p>
<p>	Immediately, I hit the switch to lock all the doors. The soldier standing right outside the driver side of the SUV spins around at the sound of the shutting door and runs up to the vehicle. A pane of glass is all that separates me from him. He yanks on the door handle, but is effectively locked outside.</p>
<p>	He quickly slings his assault rifle over his back due to the close range and pulls his handgun from his hip. He aims the weapon right at my head through the glass. The sound is muffled, but I hear the soldier yell at me, "Get out of the vehicle, or I will shoot you through the glass! Do it now!"</p>
<p>	I fumble with the keys for a second before the large SUV rumbles to life. I really hope I was right about that glass being bullet proof. I grasp the steering wheel in one hand and crank the shifter into drive with the other. My foot hits the gas pedal as a loud pop goes off right next to my ear.</p>
<p>	The driver's side window cracks into a spider web pattern. The bullet struck, but was effectively stopped without going through. Good, the glass is bulletproof. The SUV lurches forward as the man outside empties the bullets from his handgun at the vehicle. No way those bullets are getting through. I am safe for now.</p>
<p>	In the rear view mirror, I see the man throw away his handgun and pull the assault rifle off of his back. He opens fire with the heavier weapon after my SUV is about a hundred feet away. The back window cracks into multiple spider patterns and then completely shatters out. The bullets fly through, hitting the ceiling and putting a few circular cracks into the front window.</p>
<p>	Ducking down, I turn the vehicle down the lane between two full rows of cars to get out of the line of fire. This bulletproof glass must be strong enough to stop small arms like the handguns, but not enough to stop the more powerful assault rifle bullets.</p>
<p>	I head for the exit of the parking lot and see all of the men filing out from the store. Most of them scramble into the other SUV. The tires of the vehicle squeal as it speeds to intercept me. As I near the exit, I realize the other SUV will get there before I do.</p>
<p>	Wait, this is an SUV. I do not need to use the exit. I swerve the vehicle up onto the curb. The entire vehicle jolts with the shock of the tires striking the curb, but continues moving.</p>
<p>	I drive over a thin strip of grass before dropping down another curb onto the pavement of the street. The other vehicle speeds through the exit and nears dangerously close to me as both fly down the deserted streets.</p>
<p>	Okay, I have gotten myself in a high speed chase. What am I supposed to do now? I guess I will have to lose them somehow. I have seen enough car chases in movies, but never thought I would be in one myself.</p>
<p>	With no warning, I fling the steering wheel to the left and head down a side street. The other vehicle follows me easily, not falling for my ruse. Flying through red lights at near 80 mph feels odd, but there is no one else on the streets. Stopping at a red light is so ingrained in my nature, even now it seems strange not to stop.</p>
<p>	The buildings become more industrial as we head closer to downtown. I need to try and head toward the area near my apartment. Once I am back on more familiar ground it will be easier to lose my pursuers. I need to make a u-turn and head away from downtown.</p>
<p>	I turn down a narrow alley to gain some distance on my attackers. The back side of red brick buildings whiz past me in a blur as my tires splash through pooled water. A trash bin looms in front of me blocking my exit from the alley.</p>
<p>	I can not stop now. If I do, I probably will not make it out alive. I push the accelerator closer to the floor. The SUV revs higher and begins to gain speed. I brace myself for the impact.</p>
<p>	The front end of the vehicle slams into the side of the large metal bin with tremendous force. The bin is thrown to the side of the vehicle as my slightly battered SUV continues on and exits the alleyway. I look in my side mirror to see the pursuit vehicle slow slightly as it skirts around the dented trash bin before speeding up once again.</p>
<p>	I tear out of the alley and fly to the right back onto the main street. I take another right at the next intersection hoping to get out of the other SUV's line of sight. I slow to a less reckless speed when the pursuit SUV does not round the corner I just came from. The other vehicle is nowhere in sight. I drive at a steady fast pace to get as far away from the pursuit vehicle as possible.</p>
<p>	Looking all around, I try to anticipate where the other vehicle is. Maybe I have lost them. Now I can head out of town and get somewhere more safe.</p>
<p>	Midway down a block, surrounded by towering stone buildings all around, I freeze as the other SUV comes into view. I spot it on a side street connecting to the one I am driving on. I hear the engine of the other vehicle rumble louder as it merges onto the street I am on and begins to speed toward me.</p>
<p>	It would take too much time to turn all the way around, and there are no side streets between me and the other vehicle. They will be on top of me in no time if I try to reverse my way out. The only way out of this one is forward. I slam my foot onto the accelerator. I just got myself into a very deadly game of chicken.</p>
<p>	The gap between the two vehicles very rapidly draws smaller. If I turn to my right at the last second, and he turns to his left then we will collide. If I do not turn at all and neither does he then we will collide. The only way to avoid a collision is to swerve in opposite directions. A head on collision at this speed will probably kill all of us.</p>
<p>	Trying to figure out what the other driver is thinking, I realize I either have to make a decision or hope the other driver swerves. I am now close enough to see the other driver through the front windshield. The other men in the vehicle are yelling at him, but I have no idea what they are telling him to do. I wait for him to make his move first.</p>
<p>	The other driver steers his SUV to my left at the very last second. In response to his turn, I pull my wheel to the right at first to avoid the head on collision. Immediately after, I throw the steering wheel back to the left, causing my SUV to glance off the back end of the other vehicle. It begins to spin violently out of control. The soldiers' vehicle strikes the stone wall of a building head first with a terrible sound of smashed brick and breaking metal.</p>
<p>	My vehicle shudders from the impact but continues down the street. I look in the rear view mirror to see smoke and the orange glow of flames pouring out of the hood of the totaled SUV. The side doors of the vehicle open, and two of the men collapse onto the pavement and lay still by the smoldering wreckage.</p>
<p>	Maybe I should go back and help them. They are only soldiers following orders. The thought is cut short as a new black SUV emerges from the black smoke filling the street to pursue me. I slam the accelerator to the floor to speed back up. I can not believe I just survived one vehicle chasing me and now I have to escape another.</p>
<p>	The other vehicle is traveling much faster than me and rams into the back of my SUV. My vehicle jerks forward, shaking wildly. Once I am able to straighten out I try to put some distance between me and my assailants.</p>
<p>	The pursuit vehicle's windows roll down, and two soldiers inside lean out. They are holding assault rifles in their hands. Muzzle flashes and the sound of gunfire fill the quiet streets. The upholstery in my SUV begins to tear apart as bullets fly all around me.</p>
<p>	I roll down my own window and attempt to fire my assault rifle at the pursuing SUV. Driving and shooting a rifle at the same time is not nearly as easy as they make it look in the movies. My bullets fly wildly behind me, and only a few hit the window of the trailing vehicle before my gun stops firing. I must have run out of ammo. I have no idea how to reload one of these things, and even if I did there is no way I could do it while driving.</p>
<p>	I toss the empty weapon out the window, and it clatters hard against the front of the pursuing SUV. The other vehicle swerves for a second, but has little affect on the distance between us. I pull out one of my pistols and empty its clip out the window as well. The bullets from the pistol are worthless against the armor plating of the soldier's SUV. I toss the empty weapon out and it falls harmlessly to the road.</p>
<p>	Driving this vehicle is dangerous enough at these speeds, I need to concentrate on the road. I take a quick glance in the mirror and see one of the soldiers lying limp out the passenger side window. My assault rifle must have hit one of them, but there are still four more to go.</p>
<p>	Bullets continue to spray into my vehicle. I pray that none of them hit me, but it is only a matter of time before one does. The road I am on suddenly ends in a massive pile of smashed cars. Right before the wreckage, I see the ramp for the freeway and merge onto it.</p>
<p>	The other vehicle is right behind me, and follows me onto the on-ramp. This is not good. It will be much harder to lose them on the freeway than the surface streets. The only thing I can try and do on the freeway is outrun them, which will be very difficult when both our vehicles go the same speed.</p>
<p>	As soon as I enter onto the smooth surface of the freeway, I push the accelerator all the way to the floor. The other vehicle does not lose any ground but stays close behind me. I quickly take my eyes off the road for a second to look around in the cabin of the vehicle to see if one of the soldiers left behind another rifle.</p>
<p>	I still have a pistol, but it will not be able to pierce the thick armor of the SUV. If I can find another rifle, maybe I can get lucky and hit the driver.</p>
<p>	The yellow dotted lines of the road in front of me fly past in a blur as I continue down the empty freeway. The vehicle behind me lingers a few car lengths behind. They must be waiting for me to slow down or run out of gas. That is smart on their part. They do not need to put their vehicle at risk when they can just follow me and wait until I am forced to stop for one reason or another.</p>
<p>	I glance again inside the cabin of the SUV and spot a box on the floor behind the passenger's seat. The box catches my eye, because it is printed with the words, "DANGER: EXPLOSIVES." I reach behind me and try to pick up the box with one hand, while still holding onto the steering wheel with the other.</p>
<p>	It is far too heavy, and my attempt barely moves it at all. Instead of picking the box up, I flip open the lid and see spherical metal objects packed in straw to keep them from jostling against each other. Picking one up, I realize I am holding a grenade.</p>
<p>	I examine the object while still careening down the road in order to figure out how to use it. The body of the grenade is a solid sphere, with a short metal cylinder coming out of the top. A metal clip and pin is inserted into the cylinder. The explosive feels very heavy for its small size. It is amazing to think how much destruction an object like this can cause. Hopefully these will help me get that other SUV off my back.</p>
<p>	The wind whips into the vehicle, making my hair and shirt flap wildly. These high speeds are going to make this more difficult than it is already. I pull the pin of the explosive while making sure the clip remains next to the sphere. I do not want this thing detonating in my hand. I toss the grenade out of the window and see the clip fly away from the grenade. It hits the ground directly in front of the pursuing vehicle.</p>
<p>	A few seconds later, a flash of smoke and fire appears harmlessly a good distance behind the attacking SUV. The shock from the explosion shakes the freeway and our vehicles, but my pursuers continue to follow. I guess this grenade does not explode on impact, it will only explode after a delay from when the clip is released.</p>
<p>	I am going to have to time this just right. If I let go too soon, I am going to waste a grenade because it will not hit the other vehicle. If I let go too late it will explode in my vehicle sending explosive shrapnel into my body.</p>
<p>	Okay, there was at least three seconds before I dropped the grenade and when it went off, so I will hold it until I count to two and then let go. I will keep counting until it explodes to get an accurate timer count.</p>
<p>	I pick up another of the deadly spheres and pull the pin. I let go of the clip and it detaches from the body of the grenade. My heart is racing fast as I count slowly 1...2..., and then throw the explosive out the window. I continue counting 3...4... There is an explosion much closer than the last grenade I threw. The concussive blast is close enough to shake my vehicle with a rumble.</p>
<p>	I look in my rear view mirror to see if I hit the pursuit vehicle, but it remains unscathed. In response to the two explosions, the SUV behind me speeds up in an attempt to close the gap between us. The buildings surrounding the freeway have slowly turned to houses, and these have slowly grown sparser and farther apart as we leave the center of the city.</p>
<p>	Less than a car length now separates our two vehicles. I briefly take my eyes off the road, and quickly pull another grenade from the box and pull the pin. I prepare to release the clip and hold it until a count of four when my vehicle suddenly jerks forward. The other SUV had taken the opportunity to ram my back end.</p>
<p>	Surprised by the sudden impact, the grenade drops from my hand and hits the floor next to the gas pedal with a metallic thud. As the explosive drops from my hand, I see the clip detach from the sphere and fly into the passenger seat. There is a live grenade about four seconds away from exploding right beneath my feet!</p>
