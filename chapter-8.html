<h3> Chapter 8 </h3>
<p>Cresting the top of the grass, I look to see where I have ended up. I realize I traveled far from the main business district of downtown, but am still within the outskirts of the city. A road runs adjacent to the river, and on the other side of this road is a strip mall with a grocery store in the middle. 	That is just what I need. A place like that has to have something I can use to cover my wounds. Maybe there will even be a small pharmacy inside. I could use some food, too. It has been days since I have eaten last.</p>
<p>	Looking across the opposite bank of the river, a row of two story houses line a quiet street. A few of these are burned husks of their former selves, but most remain intact. Only one wrecked vehicle lays smashed against a retaining wall in a driveway. There is no sign of anyone around.</p>
<p>	Something does not feel right, and I realize it is the most silent I have ever heard the city. I can hear no sound of cars, people talking, distant sirens, or airplanes. The air is so still and quiet it is unnerving and very eerie. If it is quiet, though, that also means there are no patrols nearby to shoot at me.</p>
<p>	I turn my attention back to my own side of the river. The parking lot in front of the grocery store is half filled with cars, but there is no movement to be seen.</p>
<p>	Maybe the assault of the city began during the day. That would explain all the cars at the grocery store. I guess that would make it easier for the assailants, because they would have fewer holed up people to weed out of their homes.</p>
<p>	Looking both directions down the road and all around, I make sure my progress is not watched before leaving the cover of the tall grass. I sprint as fast as my wounded leg will carry me, though it is only really a quick hobble, across the road and into the cover of the cars in the parking lot.</p>
<p>	Everything remains quiet, except for my own gasping of breath. The bullet in my shoulder makes it much harder to breathe than normal.</p>
<p>	A bird chirps in the distance, and it is so quiet the solitary chirp seems to echo across the strip mall. Hunched over, I move from car to car in the parking lot to reduce my chances of being seen in case anyone happens to be watching. I reach the last car in the row, and after a quick glance around to make sure everything is still quiet, I dash toward the front doors.</p>
<p>	Expecting the sliding glass doors to open as I near, I barely stop myself before running into them head on. The assailants must have locked them shut after securing the store. It is so eerie to have those doors not slide open automatically during the day since they always have before.</p>
<p>	I peer inside the double set of doors and everything inside the store is dark. I can barely make out a few cash registers and check out lanes, and everything else is obscured by blackness. There is no motion inside the building.</p>
<p>	Looking closer, I spot the pharmacy on the other side of the check out lanes. My wounds throb, reminding me that I need to get something to patch them up soon. Blood is leaking down my leg and dripping onto the concrete in front of the store.</p>
<p>	I have to get inside the building and get some medical supplies. I will have to break through the glass. Looking around, I spot a pedestrian crossing sign cemented into a bucket to keep it upright. That should do perfectly.</p>
<p>	Limping over to the sign, I attempt to pick it up, but it is way too heavy. I try again, using both hands and as much strength as I can muster. It still will not budge. There is no other viable object in sight I could use to break the door.</p>
<p>	I have to do this or just give up, but who knows where I will find another place to get medical supplies. This time, I tilt the sign toward me, leaving one edge of the bucket on the ground. I roll the bucket around until it is sitting about a foot away from the glass door. Gripping the top of the sign, I yank the thin edge of the sign down as hard as I can against the glass. It connects with a loud thud, but nothing happens.</p>
<p>	Okay, try again, you can do this. I precariously stand on the bucket behind the sign, then rock it back and forth. Right when I feel it is about to tip, I push all of my weight as hard as I can toward the sign and propel it against the glass. It connects, and I fall off of the bucket and onto the ground.</p>
<p>	The glass door cracks like a spider's web, but remains intact in its frame. Must be a type of shatter resistant glass. Using my uninjured leg, I kick against the newly broken glass as hard as I can. The bottom corner pushes out from the frame making a small hole into the dark store. Knowing medical supplies and food wait for me, I scramble inside.</p>
