<h3> Chapter 20 </h3>
<p>Once the glare is gone from my eyes, I realize I am staring right at a tank. The large gun on the front is aimed towards the tree line, and the menacing vehicle sits on a road fifty feet away from the forest. Two soldiers stand next to the tank with their assault rifles aimed directly at me, and another sits inside with his head poking out a hatch in the top. This last soldier mans a large caliber machine gun mounted on top of the vehicle.</p>
<p>	The men relax a little after they see my military gear and lower their rifles. The other soldiers must not have found Ramos yet and radioed these men, but time is definitely short. One of the men approaches as I walk through the thick grass towards the road. We meet partway between the tree line and the road.</p>
<p>	"What are you doing? Why did you leave the forest?" The man asks in a puzzled, but unsuspicious, manner.</p>
<p>	Thinking quickly, I tell him the first plausible reason that pops into my head. "I fell and twisted my leg pretty bad. I also smashed my radio when it happened and left it in the forest. Without being able to call for help, I had to limp out of there."</p>
<p>	I did not even have to fake the limp. My body has been so banged up through this whole ordeal. That part of my ruse came easily.</p>
<p>	"Ya, that spill you took must have been bad. I noticed quite a limp when you came out of the trees. Base isn't too far away, it is just on the other side of those trees," the man says as he points to another section of forest opposite from the one I just left.</p>
<p>	He continues, "I can radio someone to come pick you up and give you a ride over there. We would take you, but we have orders to stay here and make sure no civilians come out of the forest."</p>
<p>	If he only knew I am the person all these soldiers are looking for. I am sure these soldiers are going to be radioed anytime that someone wearing fatigues is their quarry. My story will not hold up after that. I need to get out of here and can not wait around for them to radio someone to come pick me up.</p>
<p>	Thinking fast I say, "How far away from here is HQ? I don't want any more humiliation than is necessary. The guys in my squad are already going to give me endless grief for being injured by a fall, and having to get a ride for help is only going to make it worse."</p>
<p>	"Well, it is less than a mile from here, but I don't think you should be walking on that leg," the man says. "I understand, though. The guys in my unit gave me hell for breaking my toe once. If you think you can make it on foot, go for it."</p>
<p>	Suddenly the radio attached to his chest chirps. It is loud enough for me to hear. A metallic sounding voice distorted by the radio says, "We have located the target's hiding spot. Thermal scans from the predator confirm we are in location. Danger of individual unknown at this time, all teams proceed with extreme caution. Surround the target, and let there be no mistakes this time. Converging on target's location in five minutes."</p>
<p>	Suddenly distracted by the information from the radio, the soldier points me towards HQ and thankfully once again I have been saved. According to the radio, I only have five minutes to get away from this tank before the soldiers' suspicions will be raised.</p>
<p>	"Alright, I hope you guys catch him, I am going to walk to base," I say to the soldier as nonchalantly as possible.</p>
<p>	"Okay, get yourself patched up. I am going to the tree line to see if I can get a look at what's going on," the soldier replies distractedly. Seeing that he no longer seems to care one way or another about me, I half jog and half limp away from the tank toward the next set of trees.</p>
<p>	I need to move as fast as possible even though the pain racking my body is almost unbearable. It is only a matter of time before they find Ramos missing a uniform, and realize I have taken it. At that point, I am sure all the suspicions of the men I just talked to will be raised, and it will not take long to piece two and two together. I have to get out of range of this tank.</p>
<p>	Heading in the direction the man told me base was located, I make it toward another group of trees. If I can only make it out of sight before I am discovered, I might actually get out of this. Once I get away from the initial search area, I will have enough time to figure something else out. I need to make it to the next set of trees, though. Otherwise, there is no way I will be able to escape.</p>
<p>	I near the place of refuge out of the sight line of the tank, but it feels as if the edge of the trees and safety are still an eternity away. I try to think of how many minutes have gone by since I heard the radio say five minutes until they converge on my former hiding spot. It has to have been at least a few minutes, and they will be figuring out what happened soon enough.</p>
<p>	The three soldiers I met in the forest are probably present and will tell the others they met a soldier they did not recognize. After they radio the men with the tank, I will be screwed. The other line of trees is only fifty yards away, I can make it. Hopefully.</p>
<p>	At thirty yards away from the trees, I hear shouting from the three men in the tank. I can tell they are yelling for me to stop. They must have found Ramos already without his gear and figured out that I took it. They will be on me in no time. I have to get to those trees.</p>
<p>	The rumble of the engine of the tank breaks the calm silence of the forest. Birds take wing into the air at the sound of the tank coming to life. I can hear its roar growing nearer and risk a glance back at the monster chasing me.</p>
<p>	The tank barrels through the high grass field separating the two forested areas. It grows ever closer to me as I run as fast as I am able away from it. The soldier still has his head peeking through the top, and the other two soldiers ride on a flat part of the vehicle above the treads next to the turret.</p>
<p>	The three soldiers have their guns trained on me, but I do not hear any gunshots. The shots would be audible over the diesel powered rumble of the engine, but there are none.</p>
<p>	At least they must still have orders not to kill me. Either that, or they are being cautious because they do know for sure I am the one they are looking for. They might have some doubt I was telling the truth and really am just an injured soldier.</p>
<p>	I look backwards and see the tank is now only thirty yards away from me. Looking forward again, I realize I am only ten yards from the forest. I spin around and fire a blast of machine gun fire at the approaching vehicle, hoping maybe it will at least slow them down.</p>
<p>	I aim for the center of the vehicle, knowing it will have no effect on the tank's armor plating, but hoping it will cause the driver to slow to protect his two passengers. The two soldiers duck lower on the vehicle, but the tank continues at the same pace.</p>
<p>	An almost paralyzing fear washes over me when I realize I have to get out of the way or the tank will run me over. I am going to make it into the trees before the tank is on me. I just might get away after all.</p>
<p>	Running headlong into the trees, leaves and branches slap and scratch at my face. I am able to ignore them and continue half blind into the foliage as the adrenaline of fear pushes me forward. I hear the tank crash into the trees behind me, even though the trees I just passed were at least a foot in diameter. The trees snap like twigs under the immense pressure of the tank.</p>
<p>	The armored behemoth is so close I can feel the heat of its engine. Suddenly I am struck from behind by a very solid object and knocked to the ground. One of the soldiers riding on the front of the vehicle yells, "Stop!"</p>
<p>	Twisting on the ground trying to pry myself loose, I realize I am stuck under one of the smaller trees the tank knocked over. It is large enough that I am unable to push its weight off of me. I shove with all my might, but the tree only moves the smallest amount, not enough for me to wiggle out from underneath it.</p>
<p>	The roar of the tank engine drones down to a gentle purr, and the two soldiers riding on top jump down from the top with their guns pointed directly at me. I try to reach for my own weapon, but see that it was knocked a few feet away from my reach. The soldiers are almost on me when I remember the handgun strapped to my waist.</p>
<p>	I reach for it, but as soon as I pull it out, my hand is struck by the butt of one of the soldier's rifles. Pain shoots through my hand, and my pistol is knocked away. The soldier removes my helmet, and hits the side of my head with his rifle. Everything goes black.</p>
