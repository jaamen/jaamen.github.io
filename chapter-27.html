<h3> Chapter 27 </h3>
<p>I am unable to see the person threatening to shoot me, because they are standing directly behind me. Slowly, I put my hands up into the air. I prepare to dive into a clump of trees to get away from danger once again.</p>
<p>	"Come on, he is wearing a black jumpsuit like the other hostages, do you really think he is one of the bad guys," a man with a gruff voice says. Relaxing a little, I turn to find myself face-to-face with two men in regular clothes.</p>
<p>	An older man about 50 stands next to a younger man about my own age. The youth aims a pistol right at me, but I can see that the weapon shakes in his hands. Their clothes are so dirty they have developed their own camouflage. These must be some of the rebels who have been hiding out in the forest.</p>
<p>	"Maybe he is one of the soldiers and he changed into the jumpsuit to trick us, and now he is going to kill us once we let our guard down," the younger one says, sounding very nervous. Still too out of breath to talk, I lay helplessly on the ground gasping for air from my breakneck run. Hopefully, the older man will talk some sense into the younger one before he shoots me out of sheer nervousness.</p>
<p>	The old man slowly reaches over and takes the gun from the young man's hand. He says, "Well, let's not shoot him before we find out who he really is."</p>
<p>	The older man reaches down and offers me a hand. I take it, and he helps me to my feet. "My name is John," he says, "Now, who might you be? My young friend Shawn thinks you might be one of the soldiers, please assure him that is not the case."</p>
<p>	Once I finally begin to breath normally again, I say, "No, I am not a soldier. I actually just managed to set fire to that factory. Did any one come into the forest before me?" Hopefully, he says yes, and the hostages made it out alive.</p>
<p>	John answers, "We have been on patrol all morning, and you are the first person we have encountered since the attack earlier today. We did see some people in white and black jumpsuits run from the factory into the forest a few minutes ago, though. We can head back to camp and see if they made it. The other rebels should have rounded up anyone running into the woods. Tell me more about how you came here and how you burned down the factory."</p>
<p>	I tell him my whole story as we begin making our way through the woods towards camp. After I finish telling them all I have been through, both men seem clearly impressed. "Wow, you really did all that to make it here?" Shawn asks rhetorically.</p>
<p>	"I don't know if I can believe all of your tale, but you did elude capture from the soldiers for this long by yourself, and you did come running out of a burning building, so for now I will take your word for it," John says as we reach the outskirts of the make-shift camp.</p>
<p>	At first it looks like we have more walking to do, but then I begin to notice bedrolls and other items half buried under tree branches and dirt. I guess they would have to do a very good job of using camouflage to avoid detection. The drone must have not flown over this spot or its infrared camera would have seen these people easily.</p>
<p>	Rounding the top of a hill and looking below, I see a group of about twenty people milling about the forest. I recognize Steve among them and run down to congratulate him on freeing the other hostages. The people with weapons do not know if I am friend or foe and begin to raise their guns. They lower them after seeing Steve and I shake hands and pat each other on the back.</p>
<p>	Steve says to them all, "This is the guy I told you about. He comes out of nowhere and saves all of our skins."</p>
<p>	Slightly alarmed, I look around and say, "Are these the only people you could get out?" There were fifteen people in the group of hostages we saved from the clean room alone. There must have been many more if all the clean rooms were fully stocked. Did that many people not make it out?</p>
<p>	Steve laughs and says, "No, the others are being spread out as we speak to help us avoid detection from the remaining assailants. The fewer people we have in one place the better. They have drones out there looking for people like us. We did not have to shoot any of the soldiers either. They gave up when they realized they were outnumbered by angry hostages with guns. They are being moved to a holding area until we can figure out what to do with them. The only difference is, I am sure we will treat them much better than they treated us."</p>
<p>	Looking up, I see another group of rebels walk over the edge of the hill. There are ten people, and I can not make out their faces because the sun is high in the sky directly behind them. Suddenly, one of them breaks from the others in the group and runs straight towards me.</p>
<p>	Before I can do anything, I feel myself in a warm embrace that causes some of my tiredness to disappear. My view is blocked temporarily by flowing brunette hair, and only when the person pulls back do I realize it is Sara. My heart leaps in my chest, and I am so glad to see that she is alive and unhurt.</p>
<p>	She plants a kiss on my cheek before pulling away, and for a second I forget all about the situation. I allow myself a thought of hope that after this is all over we might have a chance of being together. Thoughts of how different my life would be if I was not so lonely race through my head before I am pulled back into the present by her voice.</p>
<p>	"What happened to you?" she says as the people around us begin talking amongst themselves, leaving the two of us alone. "I saw you fall from the top of that building and then run off into the forest. You looked badly hurt, and I was worried the soldiers would get you. I went the long way around through the trees to find where you went, but there were so many soldiers going into the trees. I was so scared for you."</p>
<p>	I answer her, and it feels strange to be able to talk to such a beautiful girl without the nervousness I used to feel. I tell her everything that happened to me since the last time we saw each other. After hearing my story, she seems even more amazed than before that I am alive and talking to her. Then I ask her, "How did you meet up with the resistance?"</p>
<p>	She replies, "I was on the edge of the other section of forest when I saw that tank crash into the trees. I went to check it out since I had no idea what else to do. By the time I got to the area around the tank, I saw them put someone in the back of a jeep and drive off. I didn't know it was you for sure, but guessed that it was."</p>
<p>	"I followed the direction of the jeep and eventually ended up in this section of the forest. I found the factory and was trying to think of a way in, when I heard explosions. The resistance had set off some home made explosives near the building. That must have been the explosion you mentioned that took Doctor Stefan out of the room. Thank God it came when it did."</p>
<p>	"Almost instantly afterwards, the drone you mentioned was overhead and the whole forest was filled with gunfire. After a few minutes, I saw the drone go down and crash into the trees. The shooting died down afterwards, and then the attacking soldiers returned to the factory. Maybe they were waiting for another drone to show up."</p>
<p>	"After the soldiers left, I went into the trees where the heaviest amount of shooting took place, and I ran into a five member team of the resistance. They immediately recognized me for a civilian and welcomed me into the cause. I told them everything I knew, and asked for their help in getting you out of there."</p>
<p>	"Right away we began planning another assault on the factory to save you and the other hostages. We never got the chance to finish our plans, because the people you rescued started shooting at the soldiers from inside the fence of the factory. The remaining hostages being held outside were only guarded by a small crew because of the rebel attacks, and were easily overpowered."</p>
<p>	"All of the freed hostages and the disarmed soldiers made it to the trees only moments before the entire factory went up in flames. I just got back from helping round up about twenty soldiers who fled into the trees after the fire went up. They are locked up in a barn nearby."</p>
<p>	"I am glad you're safe," I tell her.</p>
<p>	"I'm glad you're safe, too," she replies.</p>
<p>	I do not get the chance to talk to her more, because a thick-set man with a mustache comes over. He says to me, "My name is Paul. I am the leader of this section of the resistance. I have heard most of your story and am fairly impressed. We could definitely use the help of someone like you."</p>
<p>	Paul claps me on the shoulder and continues, "I am an ex-marine. These amateur soldiers came into our town and started tearing stuff up. I was not going to sit by and let them do it. Do you have any military training, Mark? From the list of your exploits it seems like you almost have to."</p>
<p>	"No, the closest thing I have to military training is playing video games. I just did what I thought was necessary to stay alive and to help innocent people in need," I reply.</p>
<p>	Then I ask, "Sara told me that the drone was destroyed. How did you manage to take that thing out? I thought the resistance was doomed as long as it was in the air."</p>
<p>	"John here is a marine sharpshooter," Paul says as he gestures to the man who found me on the forest floor after the explosion. "We spotted the drone hovering overhead, and he said he could shoot it down. We had our doubts, but he took it down on the first shot with a hunting rifle."</p>
<p>	Trying to hide a smile in order to maintain his modesty, John says, "Ex-marine sharpshooter. I thought I was too old for this kind of stuff, but I guess it's like riding a bike. The pilot of the drone also must have not been trained properly to use it. It was easy to take down. If we hadn't taken that drone out, though, none of us might be here right now."</p>
<p>	Paul looks directly in my eyes, and then says, "We need your help to stop this madness. You have already done enough to fight back against these monsters, but we would appreciate as much assistance as you are willing to offer. The next step we plan on making is to release a large group of hostages held at a storage facility to the south of here."</p>
<p>	"Once we have amassed a large enough force of freed people, we are going to take the fight to the arena to save the members of Congress that have been taken hostage. After that, we are headed to find the orchestrator of this attack. He is in the main offices of the First State Bank building downtown. The whole area is surrounded by the most loyal of his followers. Everyone down there personally guarding this guy are people who have been with him from the beginning. Will you join us?"</p>
<p>	At his words everything around me muffles for a second, and I think about what this could mean. Everything up until now was mostly me just trying to survive. Now I need to choose whether I want to put myself in harm's way to stop these attacks, or if I just want to run and hide somewhere.</p>
<p>	I think back to the man in the suit who died in front of me at the restaurant. That was the beginning of all this for me. I had no idea what it would lead to. I need to be there until the end. It is time for me to make a stand, with no fear. If I die, then at least I will die trying to make a difference for the better in this world. I can not watch as these monsters take over the city and then move on to change the rest of the world.</p>
<p>	Focusing back to the present, I say to Paul, "Yes, I will join you, and I will do whatever it takes to stop these soldiers from taking over this city."</p>
<p>	The clearing suddenly becomes very quiet and all eyes turn towards me. Before the start of this ordeal, I would have flinched at so much attention, but now I only feel a great courage.</p>
<p>	Right after I utter my words, a cheer rings through the resistance. I will have to get used to being a symbol of hope. It feels strange to have so many people get excited about my decisions. Everyone is clapping me on the back, and I get another hug from Sara. Paul looks straight at me, and says, "Alright, we will take the night to rest and recover, and get started first thing in the morning."</p>
<p>	I look up into the sky and am surprised to see how dark it has become. When that soldier knocked me unconscious, I must have been out much longer than I first thought. The sun is almost set in the distance, filling the western sky with streaks of red and orange.</p></p>
