<h3> Chapter 13 </h3>
<p>I groggily wake up from my stupor, and my eyes slowly begin to come back into focus. After a few seconds of disorientation, I realize I am still strapped in by my seat belt and hanging in my seat sideways. There is twisted metal all around me, and sand and water cover everything. That object I collided with must have been a barrier cone filled with sand. The cabin of the vehicle is filled with smoke, which burns my lungs every time I take a breath. I have to get out of here.</p>
<p>	My head is pounding, probably from my head striking the steering wheel. Why could this SUV not have an airbag?</p>
<p>	Dripping blood from my forehead drops onto the pavement through the shattered driver side window. I check my forehead and decide it is not life threatening at the moment, but the smoke inhalation is. Even though my seat belt saved my life moments earlier, now it is keeping me inside the smoldering vehicle. Any second, the vehicle could burst into flames or smother me with all the smoke.</p>
<p>	I push on the seat belt release button but it will not budge. Suddenly, a blast of heat washes over the vehicle, and flames lick out from underneath the hood. I scramble to find something to get me out of the seat belt, but nothing is available within the vehicle. I try to use a piece of broken glass but the available pieces are too small and the only thing I manage to do is cut my hand in the attempt.</p>
<p>	The handgun in my pocket, maybe I could use that. I pull it out and aim it at the seat-belt release. I am probably going to get hit with some metal shrapnel from this, but right now that is the least of my worries. The flames coming out of the SUV's engine grow higher and more intense. I aim the pistol, then look away as I pull the trigger.</p>
<p>	The gunshot seems exceptionally loud in the contained space of the vehicle. I feel a few painful stings in my side after the shot, but I remain restrained. The plastic covering of the seat belt release is shattered, but I can see the metal inside is still connected, imprisoning me in a deadly trap.</p>
<p>	I put the gun up against the metal this time, and fire again. My ears ring after the repeated shots of the weapon. Almost immediately after the shot, I fall sideways onto the driver side door with a surprised thud. The smoke coming out of the dashboard is almost blinding now, so I crawl between the sideways seats. I can not shoot my way out of any of these windows because they are bulletproof, I have to make it out of the shattered rear windows.</p>
<p>	The cabin of the vehicle is extremely hot, and the smoke is so strong it is disorienting. I scramble around the middle seats, but the detonation of the grenade did an effective job of smashing the rear end of the vehicle. There is only a tiny crawl space for me to get out of the rear window. </p>
<p>	I flatten my body as much as I can to squeeze through the small space and begin to pull myself through. Even more smoke is filling the vehicle, and the temperature inside feels like an oven. Broken glass cuts into my skin as I pull my body with all my remaining strength out of the window.</p>
<p>	Falling onto the rough pavement, I take glorious gasps of fresh air before realizing I still need to get away from the smoldering vehicle. I scramble to my feet and run as fast as I am able from the vehicle. Seconds later, a blast of heat and a shock wave from the car exploding carries me into the air, and I fall heavily onto my back quite a distance from where I started.</p>
<p>	I sit and look up at the burning wreckage of the vehicle. I just barely made it out of there in time. That box of grenades must have amplified the explosion. I am really sick and tired of almost dying. Hopefully, that will be the last time.</p>
<p>	Exhaustion washes over me, and I pull myself over to the edge of the bridge and sit back against the guard rail. Famished, an energy bar pulled out of my pocket gives me back some of my strength. It is a little smashed from all I have been through, but it really hits the spot.</p>
<p>	I can not stay here long, the soldiers most likely radioed for reinforcements sometime before they crashed. Also, the huge burning pile that was once my SUV is bound to draw some attention to this area of the freeway.</p>
<p>	Using the guard rail to pull myself to my feet, I survey the area around me trying to figure out where to go next. The expanse of the city stretches before me, and I can just barely make out the skyscrapers of downtown far in the distance. The only one I can identify is the Bakersville Bank Tower stretching high above all the others.</p>
<p>	Stores and shops lie directly below this part of the freeway for some distance in all directions. Beyond these I can see the beginning of the suburbs. Distant movement catches my eye. About a mile away there is some type of fenced in area with rows of low buildings and large groups of people milling about inside a fence.</p>
<p>	The people look like ants from this distance, but they are not wearing all black which means they are not the people who have been trying to kill me. I should go there to find out if they will be able to help me. I do not know who is down there, but without a vehicle it is going to be a long walk. I set off limping down the freeway looking for an exit ramp.</p>
