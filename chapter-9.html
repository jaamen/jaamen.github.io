<h3> Chapter 9 </h3>
<p>After entering the grocery store, I immediately make my way toward the pharmacy section. The shelves and the rest of the store seem completely undisturbed.</p>
<p>	The only thing amiss is the lights being turned off during the day. Being so used to twenty-four hour grocery stores with overhead fluorescent lights illuminating everything with glaring white light, the dimness in the store gives me a very weird feeling.</p>
<p>	I find the gauze and medical tape and do my best job of patching myself up. I have no experience putting dressings on wounds except for a few times I fell off my bike as a kid. Then it was only a few easy to cover scrapes. It was definitely nothing like the two bullet and knife wounds in my body now.</p>
<p>	A pain almost as intense as when I was first shot flows through my arm, leg, and shoulder as I clean out my wounds with rubbing alcohol. After I think I have cleaned them enough to stop the spread of any infection, I apply the gauze to my arm and leg. Then I use some medical tape to hold it in place.</p>
<p>	Next, I find some tweezers. This is the part I have been dreading the most. I stab the tweezers into the wound in my shoulder while biting down on an extra piece of gauze. The pain is almost too intense to handle, but I have to get the bullet out of my body. I squeeze the tweezers numerous times, each time sending throbbing pain through my shoulder, before they finally clamp around the metal shard inside of me.</p>
<p>	It is probably a good thing that this bullet did not go all the way through or it is very likely that I would have bled out. I slowly pull the tweezers and flattened bullet out of my own shoulder. Blood spurts out onto the clean linoleum floor before I slap a piece of gauze on my wound and tape it firm.</p>
<p>	As I finish, the air conditioner kicks on. The noise startles me until I realize the source. Now that my wounds have been properly dressed, I suddenly feel very conspicuous and out of place in the vast emptiness of the darkened store. I quickly dry swallow some ibuprofen to deal with the pain, and prepare to move.</p>
<p>	I look to the floor and see red drops of my own blood creating a clear trail from where I am standing to the door. Anyone seeing the broken door would have no problem realizing there is someone alive in here. I pour some of the rubbing alcohol down my arm and leg to clean off the excess blood. If anyone does come here, I do not want to leave them an obvious trail to where I am going next.</p>
<p>	The oppression I feel from the spacious empty store begins to wear on me, and I get the feeling I need to leave the deserted store. The desire for fresh air gets greater by the second, but my growling stomach tells me I need to stay for a while longer. I have to eat something before I leave. I have not had any food since that cereal the night I was abducted, and that was days ago.</p>
<p>	I quickly walk over to the section of the store with energy bars. These should keep me sustained for a while. I rip open a bar and scarf it down. My stomach feels much better with food in it now, and the weakness I felt begins to wane. I shove as many bars as I can fit into my pockets. Who knows when I will have another chance to get a hold of more food.</p>
<p>	Feeling better, I head towards the exit as a black SUV drives up in front of the store. I freeze behind one of the checkout lanes to stay out of sight. A soldier in body armor hops out of the back seat to investigate the broken glass. He uses his assault rifle to poke at the hole where I crawled into the store.</p>
<p>	The blood from my wounds is bright red in the sunlight outside and clearly apparent on the shattered glass. He gestures to his partners in the vehicle, and four more men in body armor with assault rifles climb out. This is not good.</p>
<p>	Staying low and out of sight, I run to the end of an aisle of food. I peer out from my hiding spot, and see the men using a large metal object they took out of the SUV as a battering ram to break down the entire glass door. The glass gives way and the men stroll into the building, crunching glass beneath their boots.</p>
<p>	The soldier in front raises his arm and points to the other four men. He then points to different areas of the building indicating where each of them should go. Four of the men begin to fan out and move down different aisles of the building and out of my sight. The last one stays back by the checkout lanes at the front of the store, blocking the main exit.</p>
<p>	I can not let them catch me. I have seen what they do. If they get a hold of me, I am dead. At a loss as to what to do and having no idea where each of the assailants are now except for the one at the front of the store, I need to think fast.</p>
<p>	Hearing the jostle of one of the men's equipment, I realize he is right around the corner in the aisle to my left. I take a chance and dash down the aisle to the right, knowing they do not have enough men to cover all of the aisles. Luckily, the aisle is deserted. One of them could move into this aisle at any second. I need to keep moving.</p>
<p>	I am in the cereal aisle of the store, so I look for the emptiest row closest to the ground. Thankfully, it looks like the store has not stocked their groceries for a while. I find a perfect spot and scramble onto the shelf after moving a few boxes out of the way. I look back and see a rifle poke into my aisle. Seconds away from being spotted, I move a cereal box in front of me and try to control my labored breathing.</p>
<p>	I can see through the cracks left by the boxes in front of me, and the soldier walks into the aisle where I was standing just moments before. As he steps into view, I realize I had knocked a box of cereal onto the floor when scrambling onto the shelf. Petrified, I try to control the beating of my own heart. The store had looked undisturbed before I had entered, and this cereal box was the only thing other than my first aid job out of place.</p>
<p>	The patrol walks swiftly over to the box of cereal and crouches down to pick it up. He is so close to me I can hear his breathing. All he has to do is glance a little to his left and he will spot me staring back at him. The man speaks quietly into his mouthpiece radioing his comrades, "I found a box of food knocked off the shelf, but other than that it is all clear. Anyone else spot anything?"</p>
<p>	A tinny voice replies just loud enough for me to hear from the patrol's helmet, "Only a blood trail leading to some used medical supplies. They look extremely fresh. Either he scrambled out of here minutes before we arrived, or he is still somewhere inside. Stay put, and I will check the security footage to find out if he left or not."</p>
<p>	The soldier in my aisle remains crouched but keeps his eyes straight ahead. After a few seconds, the voice continues, "I checked the security footage of the parking lot from the store office. It shows someone breaking through the glass and crawling into the building. There is no footage of him leaving, so he is still here. I am going to check the in-store footage now to see where he holed up. Unless he found an exit I don't know about yet, he is still here. Once we figure out where he is, we will kill him and clear out of here."</p>
<p>	At this statement, my blood runs cold and shivers of terror run up my spine for a brief instant. Then my adrenaline kicks in, and I know what I have to do. I am tired of being hunted and shot at. I can not just wait for them to kill me. If I want to get out of here alive, I am going to have to fight back.</p>
<p>	The soldier in my aisle stands up and begins moving back to the front of the store to regroup with his team. Before he gets too far away, I reach my arm out from behind the boxes of cereal and grab his leg. His forward momentum carries him to the floor. I roll out from my hiding place, knocking cereal boxes everywhere, and I attempt to grab his gun away from him.</p>
<p>	The soldier springs to his feet with me clinging onto his back with my arms around his neck. He attempts to spin around to throw me off, but I refuse to let go. As I squeeze my arms tight to choke him, my swinging leg hits his belt. I realize he is carrying a pistol at his side. Still holding on for dear life with one arm, I reach the other one down and whip the handgun out of his holster and press it to his neck.</p>
<p>	I whisper loud enough for him to hear without alerting the other soldiers, "If you don't stop moving, I am going to shoot you in the neck. Your body armor won't help you much there, will it?"</p>
<p>	The man stops struggling when he realizes his predicament. I plant both my feet back onto the ground and order him to set down his assault rifle. He sets it quietly on the ground, then stands straight up again. He turns to look at me, keeping his hands in the air. I can faintly hear a tinny voice asking him his status inside of his helmet.</p>
<p>	"Tell them I am not here if you want to live," I command with as much menace as I can muster.</p>
<p>	The man calmly says into his microphone, "I have been attacked and have a gun at my neck. All units to the cereal aisle."</p>
<p>	I can not believe what I am hearing. I ask the man, "Why did you say that? Don't you think I will shoot you?"</p>
<p>	The defiant soldier replies to my snidely, "I don't think you can shoot me, or you would have done it already. Come on do it. I will bet my life you won't."</p>
<p>	Seething with anger and nearly paralyzed by fear, I try to will myself to pull the trigger, but he is right. I can not just kill a man in cold blood while looking him in the eyes. Maybe I can at least use him as a bargaining chip with the other soldiers.</p>
<p>	Three more soldiers round the corner of the aisle with their guns raised and leveled directly at me. The only thing standing between them and me is the weaponless soldier staring me in the face. My prospects look bleak.</p>
