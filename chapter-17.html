<h3> Chapter 17 </h3>
<p>I slowly wake up as warmth from the sun hits my face, contrasting sharply with the coldness of the concrete structure. I turn over and realize Sara is gone from beside me. A feeling of loneliness I did not expect washes over me.</p>
<p>	I just met this girl, but we stayed up late into the night talking, and it did not take long for me to feel a connection. It seemed like she felt a connection too, and it does not hurt that she is very pretty.</p>
<p>	I have not had very good luck with pretty girls in the past. I can not even remember how long it has been since I had even talked to a girl I was attracted to before last night. Being busy most of the time with work and school while also being shy around women are not good combinations for companionship.</p>
<p>	As soon as Sara had come into my life though, she is gone. I wonder where she went, and why she left. Once my eyes adjust to the glaring sunlight, I see chalk marks on the concrete pillar that  supports the floor above.</p>
<p>	I stand up, stretching to remove the stiffness, and feel pain in most of my body. It is a strong reminder that I have been shot multiple times and my body has been fairly well beaten up in the last few days.</p>
<p>	Walking over to the pillar, I see Sara left me a note with some chalk left behind by the construction workers. My feelings of loneliness are replaced by hope immediately after seeing the note. It reads, "I went to go get some water from the creek. Be back soon. Thank you again for everything. - Sara."</p>
<p>	Suddenly a small pebble clatters off the pillar before my eyes and ricochets into the structure. It bounces off some tools and falls off the side of the unfinished building. I look for its source and see Sara waving frantically from the edge of a large clump of trees. Delighted to see her again, I wave back until I realize she is not waving but trying to tell me something. She looks frightened.</p>
<p>	Sara points to the area behind the construction site, and I can only remember there being a large field of waist-length grass. I run to the edge of the structure and throw myself flat on the concrete so I can peer over the edge while remaining out of sight. My eyes quickly search the area, and I am shocked at what I see.</p>
<p>	The first thing I notice is something hovering in the air not too far in front of me. It is white and shaped like a small airplane. So small in fact, it has no room for a pilot. Before I can study it more, the vehicle streaks off into the distance.</p>
<p>	I am not sure, but that looked like a drone. The military uses those unmanned airplanes to hunt down terrorists overseas without putting the pilots at risk. It makes sense the soldiers taking over the city would use them to hunt down targets. I wonder how long this one has been following me. Surely it could not have flown in the storm from last night, so it must have found me only this morning. I hope it did not see Sara travel into the trees.</p>
<p>	I pictured the drone flying around the city taking video of everything and sending it back to a command center somewhere. The people inside would analyze the data as they told the man in control where to fly next. My heart drops when I realize they are using this kind of technology to hunt me down. This whole scenario just become even more dangerous.</p>
<p>	The second thing I see as I look out across the field are five men in camouflage military uniforms trouncing through the tall grass. It is hard to make out too many details from such a distance, but it seems as though they are armed to the teeth. Each one is carrying some type of assault rifle, and some have larger weapons that look like they might carry explosives on their backs.</p>
<p>	I try to think clearly about what I should do, but my mind is muddled, and I feel groggy after only waking up a few minutes ago. One thing I know for sure is no matter what I decide to do, I can not go to Sara. That would only lead the soldiers to her and her recapture.</p>
<p>	My mind races as I try to think, but I know I am running out of time as the soldiers near my position. I could just run down the stairs and make a break for it in the opposite direction of Sara. I would not make it far though, because they would gun me down before I made it to the safety of the trees.</p>
<p>	I have not yet made up my mind about my next course of action when I hear footsteps on the stairs below. The group I saw walking through the tall grass must be another unit. A group of them are already here. I run to the other side of the unfinished bank and signal to Sara to move away. I see her sink into the trees, and I hope she is smart enough to stay there.</p>
<p>	I ready my assault rifle and crouch down behind the stack of pipes with my gun trained on the stairs, ready for the first soldiers to show themselves. I will not be able to hold them all off, but I might be able to take down a few before they get me.</p>
<p>	Suddenly I see a round object come up from the lower floor and land close to the top of the stairwell. I realize what it is and  duck down behind the pipes as a loud explosion instantly deafens me.   A blinding light flashes in front of my closed eyelids.</p>
<p>	If I had not been behind cover when that thing went off there is a good chance it would have knocked me unconscious. That must have been some kind of stun grenade since there is no shrapnel or explosive damage left from the grenade.</p>
<p>	My eyesight is only temporarily impaired and sight quickly returns. Good thing I closed my eyes before it went off, or I would not be able to see to save my life. My ears are still ringing, and I can not hear anything.</p>
<p>	I see the first two soldiers come running up the stairs, and I squeeze the trigger while I aim the front of the rifle at them. The flash of the gunfire erupts from the end of my weapon, but I am unable to hear it. I hope that grenade did not permanently damage my hearing, but that is the least of my worries right now.</p>
<p>	My head is still reeling from the concussion of the stun grenade, and my aim is less than true. The men dive quickly back down the stairs unharmed. The concrete area around the top of the stairwell is now covered with small craters from the bullets. I do not know how many rounds I have left in this assault rifle, but I know I will not be able to fight off all of those soldiers.</p>
<p>	In the mental clarity brought on by the adrenaline, I am distracted by my thoughts while still keeping my aim on the stairwell. Something does not seem right about this situation. I know these soldiers are here to get me, but why use a stun grenade? Also, why did the drone not level this construction site and take me out without a fight. I know they are able to carry missiles, so why not use them?</p>
<p>	They know I do not have any hostages, unless they thought Sara was one, but the drone saw me as the only one up here before it flew away. Otherwise, some of the soldiers would have gone into the trees to retrieve her. Then it hits me, and a slight feeling of relief washes over me. They are trying to take me alive, and are going out of their way not to kill me. Why would they do that?</p>
<p>	I do not know any information they could possibly want, and I think I have caused them enough trouble that they would want to put me down. Unless they think I am part of some sort of organized resistance. I have been going lone wolf on this thing so far until I met Sara.</p>
<p>	I would have loved to have met up with someone else who is fighting back against whoever these people are, but so far fate decided otherwise. There has to be some resistance out there, though. I can not imagine everyone just giving themselves up without a fight.</p>
<p>	The soldiers are probably trying to take me alive because they think I can lead them to these resistance groups. I will most likely be tortured to give them information, but once they find out I do not know anything useful, chances are they will put a bullet in my head.</p>
<p>	Once I am captured the only thing I have to look forward to is torture or death. I can not let them take me.</p>
<p>	All these thoughts quickly go through my brain as I try to think of what to do next. Every sound I hear is barely audible, like listening through ear muffs. I can not rely on my ears. I will have to use my other senses instead if I want to make it out of here without being caught.</p>
<p>	I will not be able to hear the soldiers when they come up the stairs, and I do not have enough ammo in my weapons to take them all. I might be able to pick off a few, but not many more before they overpower me. I have to find another way, but we are three stories off the ground. Jumping from this height would at least cripple me, if not kill me.</p>
<p>	Quickly scanning the area, I spot a rope with a carabiner attached to the end of it. The construction workers must have used it to help prevent hitting the dust in case of a fall. The rest of the rope is lying in coiled heap.</p>
<p>	After firing a salvo of bullets at the stairwell to buy me a few seconds before the soldiers reemerge at the top, I sprint over to the unattached end of the rope and lay it down in front of a large sand bag. With an enormous amount of effort, I roll the sand bag over the rope once, then fasten the rope securely around the bag. Good, that sandbag seems to weigh about as much as I do.</p>
<p>	Moving quickly, I step into a harness left behind by a construction worker. I run the rope through a strap on the harness, and make sure the carabiner is secure. I am effectively tethered to the sandbag.</p>
<p>	I look back at the stairwell, and as soon as I see black coming up the stairs, I steel myself for the inevitable pain of my next course of action. Then I jump out into the morning sky.</p>
<p>	I hope I made the right decision, because if this rope is too long, I do not think I will survive the fall. I suppose anything is better than being tortured to death, though.</p>
<p>	The wind rushes past my face as I plummet ever faster toward the ground. The dirt area surrounding the construction site speeds up to meet me, and I brace for the impact of the ground. This could be the last second of my life.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, my fall is wrenched to a halt. Pain shoots through my entire body as the rope goes taut only three feet above the ground. The assault rifle clatters to the ground beneath me. I feel the sand bag above me pull forward, and I land heavily on the ground. The sandbag plummets to the ground after me, and I quickly roll out of its path.</p>
<p>	The sandbag crashes into the ground only a few inches from my body. The bag splits open, covering me with a spray of course sand.</p>
<p>	The rope, carabiner, and harness work enough to prevent any broken bones, but my torso and legs feel like they were almost ripped in half from the jerk at the end. My back hurts from where I landed in the dust as well, but there is no time to stop and lick my wounds.</p>
<p>	I spring up as spryly as I can and feel intense pain throughout my body. I have to move now. They are going to realize what happened soon, and I need to be as far away from here as possible. 	After detaching the rope from the harness and picking up my assault rifle, I hobble toward a heavily forested area near to where I landed. It is in the opposite direction from Sara's location. Even if they catch me, at least I can lead the assailants away from her.</p>
<p>	The safety of the trees is still at least a hundred yards away when I hear shouts from above. They must have realized I am no longer inside the structure. More shouts becoming frantic echo through the building site and come across the field. I can just barely understand them as my hearing slowly comes back.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, the ground in front of me moves. Dirt is kicked up and peppers my face. Still traveling as fast as I can, I continue to run toward the trees. The gunshots ring out from above, but all the bullets fall around my feet. They are aiming at my legs, hoping to cripple me without killing me.</p>
<p>	The mud and dirt around my feet springs into the air every time it is struck with a bullet, but I remain unharmed as I near the trees. Shooting to wound instead of to kill must be throwing their aim off. If these are trained soldiers, I am sure they would have no problem killing me from that range, but aiming for only the legs must be a little tougher.</p>
<p>	I dive into the bushes marking the edge of the tree line, and immediately the sound of gunfire ceases. After rolling along the ground for a short way, I immediately stop to examine myself for any bullet wounds. I did not feel any pain from a bullet, but my adrenaline was running so high, I could have gotten hit and not even realized it. Luckily, I seem to have no fresh wounds.</p>
<p>	I am out of breath to the point I can barely gasp in enough air to stop from passing out. My body aches all over from my injuries and has never been in this much pain before. Struggling to my feet, I make my way deeper into the trees to put as much distance between me and the soldiers as I can.</p>
<p>	They saw where I went into the trees, and it will not take them long to get to where I dove in. Good thing for me they were all in the structure I jumped out of. It will take them longer to get to the tree line. Maybe if I can get far enough into the trees I can lose them.</p>
<p>	After traveling a good way into the forest, I suddenly realize I will not be able to make it very much farther. The pain from the fall is just too much to handle, and darkness begins to creep in around my eyes. To prevent passing out and letting them find me lying exposed on the ground, I stop and look for a place to hide while I catch my breath.</p>
<p>	I spy an uprooted tree a few yards away from where I am standing. The behemoth of a tree looks like it collapsed from old age and tipped over sideways. There is a small hole created by an arch in the trunk of the fallen giant just large enough for my body. A patch of green moss grows on the top of the tree, and smaller branches, most of them broken, cover the forest floor underneath.</p>
<p>	I lay down and wedge my body into this cleft. There is barely enough room for me to fit, but I end up being quite snug once inside. After I pull branches closer to me, and taking into account how covered in dirt and mud my clothes are, it seems as though it will make a very effective hiding spot.</p>
