<h3> Chapter 31 </h3>
  <p>Windows neighboring the one I rolled out of shatter from the grenade blast, sending glass flying all around me as I fall. After a twelve foot drop, my back connects with a solid surface covered in broken glass. Pain shoots through my body. My assault rifle is knocked from my hands and clatters off the ledge to plunge to the depths below.</p>
	<p>The Bakersville Bank Tower extends fifty floors into the air, but at the thirty sixth floor it begins to taper in a staircase fashion every five floors until the very last couple of floors that stretch straight up. I landed on the very first of these tiers.</p>
	<p>If I was two floors lower, right now I would be nothing more than a splatter on the pavement below. My head is close enough to the edge that I am able to watch my assault rifle fall all the way to the ground. I can barely see it smash into pieces on the street.</p>
	<p>I stagger to my feet and feel blood ooze down my back from the cuts of glass. My back aches horribly from the fall, but I manage to stay on my feet and keep moving. Wind whips around the tower, threatening to throw me off in a large gust. I keep my back to the building to decrease my chances of being swept off.</p>
	<p>Moving swiftly, I get as far away from the spot I fell as possible. I know the men above will try to find my body. I took out a few of them and they will be looking to make sure I am dead. When they see the blood spot from where I hit the ledge, they will find me and finish me off.</p>
	<p>I move around the corner of the building so the soldiers will not be able to pick me off from the broken windows above. The wind is even stronger on this side, and I realize the building was blocking most of the wind when I fell. Now I have met it full force, and it is a struggle to move or even stay on the ledge.</p>
	<p>Suddenly, the window my back is pressed up against explodes in a storm of broken glass. I fall to the ground as I realize they are shooting at me from inside the building. The men must have either traveled to the lower floor already, or someone on this floor spotted me.</p>
	<p>I scramble inside the building through the newly broken window. This floor is almost identical to the one above it, and I quickly duck behind one of the cubicle dividers to get out of the line of gunfire.</p>
	<p>Checking my surroundings, I notice there is a door that reads, "Stairs," only a few feet away from me. The door has a card reader next to it, and the light on it is red meaning the door is locked. A large open space lies between me and the door that would provide one of the soldiers a great opportunity to put a bullet inside me before I could make it in the door.</p>
	<p>Taking my pistol from its holster, I inhale a deep breath. I grasp my weapon in one hand and the security pass card in the other. I will have only one chance at this.</p>
	<p>Springing up, I fire as many rounds as I can from my pistol in the direction of the soldiers, while at the same time running for the door. The soldiers duck for cover, and I swipe my card as I throw open the door. I fire a round into the card scanner outside the door and then jump inside. The door slams behind me on its automatic hinges.</p>
	<p>Seconds after the door closes the handle jiggles up and down, but the men are locked out because of the broken card scanner. I have to move fast. They will be able to use the elevator to get to another floor and then move into the staircase from there. I need to be gone before they do. I begin running up the stairs two by two using my fear, adrenaline, and determination to save my friends to move swiftly up the stairs without tiring.</p>
	<p>I make it up countless stairs and feel like I should be nearing the top when I hear the loud echo of a door slamming open in the hallway below me. I hear someone from below me yell, "Which way do you think he went, up or down?"</p>
	<p>As soon as I hear his question, a thought pops into my head. I can buy myself some time if I can make them think I went down instead of up. I pop the nearly empty clip out of my handgun and hold it in the center of the stairwell. There is an open space a few feet square in the stairwell stretching from the very top to the very bottom. Looking down more than forty stories into the void makes my head spin due to the dizzying depths and the spiral effect of the stairs surrounding it.</p>
	<p>I hold the ejected clip out into this space and let it slip from my fingers. I watch for a few seconds as it plunges towards the bottom floor before resuming my ascent to the top. After climbing a few more stairs, I hear it clatter far below.</p>
	<p>A man beneath me says, "He must be below us, let's get him!" The sound of many boots pounding stairs fills the area, masking the sound of my own footsteps climbing in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p>Eventually, I make it to a door with a placard that reads, "50th Floor Executive Suite." The stairs continue on, but a sign next to them reads, "Roof Access Only." I have arrived. This has to be where Rasputin is hiding.</p>
	<p>I hold the pass card up to the red sensor next to the door. It turns green and there is a click as the lock for the door is disengaged. Holding my pistol out in front of me in case of another firefight, I push the door open.</p>
	<p>The room is deserted, but three closed doors indicate that this floor has at least a few more rooms. Wow, this floor is very different from the others I saw on my way up here. The cubicles and bland colors are gone, replaced by opulent grandeur everywhere the eye can see.</p>
	<p>Rich, dark wood covers the walls. Matching coffee and end tables surround plush recliners and sofas. The light in the room is dim and soft compared to the bright fluorescent lights of the other floors.  The large picture windows look out onto an amazing view. The carpet is thick dark green, and sinks under my feet.</p>
	<p>This must be where the big wigs of the company come to relax or impress prestigious clients. I am beginning to understand a little bit more why Rasputin chose this as his headquarters, being the megalomaniac that he is.</p>
	<p>The room that I am in seems to encompass only a small portion of the top floor. A door on the other side of the elevator hallway in the center is marked with the words, "Executive Boardroom." I can hear voices coming from the other side of the door. Rasputin has to be in there. I will make him tell me where he is hiding my friends.</p>
	<p>I use my radio to contact John. "I made it to the top floor, and I think Rasputin is only a door away from me. What is your status?"</p>
	<p>The radio crackles and John replies, "I am still inside the Atlantic Union Building. You should be thankful that the early morning fog has lifted already. I saw some of your exploits on the lower floor and took out a few soldiers for you. I am not sure you noticed, though, because you seemed a little busy."</p>
	<p>I reply, "No, I did not notice, but thanks for the assistance. Can you find any activity on the 50th floor? I am on the South side right now, but will be going through a door into the North side." </p>
	<p>John answers, "I am still scanning, but I am sure I will find any if there is. By the way, I used the radio and called for reinforcements from the other resistance groups I could contact. They will be there soon, but Rasputin might have our friends shot before they arrive. You should hurry and confront Rasputin, and I will cover you as soon as I locate your position."</p>
	<p>I say into the radio, "Okay, I am going to see if I can crack the door a bit to find out what is going on. I will keep you posted." The door is one that slides open, and I move it the smallest amount that gives me a good view of the room.</p>
	<p>A tall, pale man with a scowl on his face is standing next to the solid wall beside the window holding a large caliber pistol. Between him and me lies a large boardroom table and the captives I have been searching for. They are all standing up facing him, but I am able to recognize the backs of Paul and Sara. Seeing Sara makes my heart leap, and then plunge once more when I remember how much danger we are all in.</p>
	<p>Past Rasputin and outside of the windows is a large sign on top of a building that says "Atlantic Union Insurance." I slide the door back closed quietly and say into the radio, "John, aim your scope at the center of the top floor of the Tower and tell me what you can see."</p>
	<p>"Okay. It's a little hard to see inside due to my lowered angled, but I can make out what looks to be a boardroom table. There might be some people standing on the other side of the table, but I can not see into the building that far," the radio squawks back at me.</p>
	<p>I radio back, "The people you can barely see are our friends. Rasputin is standing out of sight next to the window with a gun. I will go in and see if I can get him to move in front of the glass so you can get a bead on him."</p>
	<p>John chirps in, "If those are the captives, I might not be able to take a shot at Rasputin without the risk of hitting one of our friends. You might have to find a way to get them to safety before I can make a clean shot."</p>
	<p>I say, "Alright, I will leave the radio on so you will be able to hear what happens in there, but I will not be able to hear you. I do not want Rasputin to know I have help on the outside. Stay sharp. If you get a chance to shoot Rasputin without endangering the captives, do it."</p>
	<p>John radios back, "Okay, I will have your back. Best of luck to you, Mark."</p>
	<p>I push the talk button down and lock it into place so John can hear everything that happens in the boardroom. With my pistol held in front of me, I open the door and step boldly into the room.</p>
