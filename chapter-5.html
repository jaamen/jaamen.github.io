<h3> Chapter 5 </h3>
<p>I open my eyes and am briefly blinded by the harsh light overhead. I sit up on the edge of my cot and stretch an aching back. There is no way to tell how long I have been asleep, but I feel very groggy.</p>
<p>	Samuel said I would be out for days. I wonder how much time has passed.</p>
<p>	The silence inside my cell is oppressive with the only noise being the constant hum of the lights overhead. All my thoughts are questions without answers except my most immediate thought: I really have to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>	I walk over to the door and knock on it, hoping someone on the other side is close enough to hear. A few moments later, the door opens a crack and there is a man in body armor on the other side staring in at me.</p>
<p>	“Stop knocking on the door or I will come in there and make you stop knocking. It will be harder for you to knock with a broken hand."</p>
<p>	As he moves to shut the door, I muster my courage and say, “I really need to use the restroom. Unless you feel like cleaning up a mess in here, you should probably let me use one.”</p>
<p>	The man looks down the hall and then shuts the door and locks it again. I hear his footsteps recede down the hall, echoing on the linoleum floors. I wait patiently, but my bladder feels like it is going to burst.</p>
<p>	I back up when the footsteps grow louder, signaling the guards return. The door opens a crack once more. The guard looks in and says “All right, move back and don't try anything stupid. You'll get your bathroom break.”</p>
<p>	The door opens, and the guard stands with his sidearm drawn. He backs up and orders me out of the room, using his gun to point me to the right. I slowly walk in front of him to a door about a hundred feet down the hall from mine. He gestures towards the door, and I open it.</p>
<p>	I move over to the toilet to relieve myself when I notice blood on the sink, mirror, and floor. Streaks of crimson move across the reflective surface of the mirror as though someone had tried to grab onto anything before they collapsed onto the floor.</p>
<p>	The pooled blood on the floor has the imprint of a recently moved body. I flush the toilet and opt for the hand sanitizer in the wall dispenser instead of using the sink to wash my hands after I relieve myself.</p>
<p>	Disgusted and feeling sick, I step out of the bathroom and gesture to the bathroom at the guard who is standing impatiently against the wall.</p>
<p>	I ask him, “Did you know the bathroom is covered in blood?”</p>
<p>	The guard looks at me and says, “I already know. Move to your room, now.”</p>
<p>	As we walk down the hall to my cell, a man about my own age wearing jeans and a green t-shirt comes tearing around the corner down the hall. His eyes are wide with fear, but he does not turn around when he sees the guard with me.</p>
<p>	He continues to sprint toward me yelling, “You've got to get out of here! They are going to kill you, they are going to kill all of us! We didn't do anything, but they are going to kill us all! Escape with me!”</p>
<p>	The guard standing next to me quickly reaches down and pulls his sidearm from his holster. The sprinting man gets ten feet in front of us when a huge explosion reverberates in the narrow hallway. A hole opens in the man's chest where the bullet connects with his body and he collapses to the floor.</p>
<p>	The man slides to within a few feet of where I am standing from his running momentum. A crimson streak trails from where the man fell to his final resting place. The wounded man lays still, and I do not know if he is alive or dead. I avert my gaze to avoid seeing the gore.</p>
<p>	Two guards wearing similar body armor emerge from the hallway that the escapee did. They stop running when they see the man covered in blood lying on the floor. They nod at the guard who fired the shot.</p>
<p>	"Thanks for taking him out. He wrenched away from us during a bathroom break," one of them says.</p>
<p>	My guard replies, "Just see that you do not let anyone else escape. We do not want the bosses angry at us. They will kill us if we let anyone get away."</p>
<p>	The two other guards turn around and walk down the hall without another word.</p>
<p>	After seeing what my guard just did, I am not about to say anything to give him a reason to hurt me too, so I allow my guard to walk me back to my cell in silence.</p>
<p>	The guard shoves me into my room and says “Don't worry about him, that is what will happen to you too if you try to escape.” He slams the door, and I am once again left to myself.</p>
<p>	What is going on? Why are they killing people without even a second thought about it? What if they decide to shoot me too? This thought sends a chilling tingle down my spine, and I begin to think about how I can get out of this situation.</p>
<p>	These people are going to take over and control the city? They have no respect for human life, and many people will die. Samuel said that unless I wanted to help them, they are going to kill me. I have no desire to help these monsters or be killed. I have to figure out a way to escape, but how?</p>
<p>	I sit on the edge of the bed as a cold sweat breaks out on my forehead. They might decide to kill me at any time, if I do not think of a way out of here soon.</p>
<p>	I realize I have a choice to make that could be the difference between life or death. After mulling it over in my head for a long while, I finally make my decision. I am not going down without putting up some kind of fight. I felt powerless and ashamed when I froze up earlier in the restaurant, and I am not going to let that happen again.</p>
<p>	Coming up with a plan, I think I might be able to sneak out of this building without alerting too much attention.</p>
<p>	I take off my left shoe and position it so it just barely pokes out from the shadows underneath the cot. Then I remove my shirt and place it so the left sleeve is hardly visible out of the shadows as well. From the doorway, it almost looks like I am laying underneath the bench.</p>
<p>	Hopefully this ruse will look realistic enough to fool the guard.</p>
<p>	I stand with my back against the wall beside the door, the concrete feeling cold against my shirtless back. I reach over and hammer a few times on the door and yell, “Hey! I feel sick, I need to go to the bathroom again. I am going to throw up all over this room if you don't take me to the bathroom.” 	The door opens a crack as the guard looks in and then flies open. The open door effectively hides me from the guard's view. I see the guard's hand firmly gripped around his sidearm as he enters into the cell.</p>
<p>	“Get out from under the cot, now! I am going to come in there and make sure you stop knocking!”</p>
<p>	The guard slowly walks toward the cot, with his gun arm extended. It is now or never. I put my leg out to trip the guard as he walks into the room. At the same time, I grab for the gun with my right hand and shove on the guard's back with my left.</p>
<p>	The guard sees me out of his peripheral vision and begins to swing the gun toward me as my sweeping leg connects with his foot. My shove gives the guard enough momentum to fall toward the floor. My grab for the gun misses completely, and I almost have a moment of panic as I think, I'm dead. He is going to shoot me.</p>
<p>	Relief washes over me as the guard hits the floor and the gun flies out of his hand. I dive for the gun as the guards regains his bearings and makes a lunge for it as well. I fall on top of the guard and grab the gun a split second before he does.</p>
<p>	Before I can point the gun at the guard, his hand grabs mine. He tries to twist the barrel away from him and back into my direction. His other hand flies to his hip, and I see the glint of steel as a knife is pulled from its sheath.</p>
<p>	I grab onto the gun with both hands and the extra strength allows me to push the gun barrel against the guard's exposed neck between his armor and helmet. A sharp pain shoots up my arm as the knife slashes me, and I let out of a cry of pain. The guard raises the knife again to stab into my chest, but he does not get the chance. I pull the trigger.</p>
<p>	The man beneath me goes limp, and the knife clatters to the floor. I barely heard the shot, because the sound of my beating heart in my ears is so loud from the rush of adrenaline. I stand up and look at the guard's body on the floor.</p>
<p>	The realization of what just happened, and the realization my own body is covered with the guard's blood washes over me. I lose the little contents my stomach had in them on the floor next to the puddle of the guard's blood.</p>
<p>	I just killed a man. I only meant to take away the guard's weapons and lock him in the cell while I snuck out of the building. Things did not go as planned.</p>
<p>	Once the initial shock is over, I have a moment of mental clarity. That gunshot was loud enough to alert half the building, I have to get out of here, now!</p>
<p>	I quickly throw on my shoe and shirt from beneath the bench and run out into the hallway. I look both directions trying to decide which way to go. No one has come looking to see what happened yet, but I know there is not much time before they do. I tightly grasp the gun that is still in my hand, and I try to remember which way we had come when I first got here.</p>
<p>	I run to the first intersection of hallways and see that all four hallways in every direction just end in a corner leading to another hallway. I hear shouts coming from the hallway to my left so I run down the one to the right, hoping I can find a way out.</p>
<p>	I reach the end of the hallway, turn the corner and see a double set of gray doors in the distance, but they seem impossibly far away. There is a red exit sign lit up above them. Thank God, an exit. This not being a prison, but only another building formed into a prison, is working to my advantage.</p>
<p>	 Running down the long hallway, the shouts became louder behind me. A quarter of the way down the hall I risk a glance back and see eight guards decked out in full body armor turn the corner and begin running after me with their guns drawn.</p>
<p>	The adrenaline of the chase pushes me forward, and I run as I have never run before. I am starting to gain distance from the guards, slowed down by their heavy armor, when they open fire. The echoes of the gunshots are deafening in the narrow hall, and it is impossible to tell just how many shots are fired.</p>
<p>	I am at least a hundred feet in front of them as the shooting begins. I hope I have a large enough lead on them that they will have a hard time hitting me.</p>
<p>	A bullet hole suddenly appears to the left of me on the wall, and the white plaster explodes out showering me with bits of powder. In an attempt to slow down my pursuers, I point the gun back over my head and fire off a few shots.</p>
<p>	Not risking to look back to see if I hit anything, I push myself to run even faster as the gray doors loom nearer. I am within five feet of the door when one of the greatest pains I have ever felt tears through my leg. I look down to see blood spurt onto the floor as my leg gives out, and I fall towards the ground.</p>
<p>	My forward momentum carries me through the unlocked gray doors, and I tumble down a short flight of stairs before coming to a rest in a rain-soaked alleyway. The rain spatters all around me in the dark night, only distantly lit by dim yellow street lights half a block away.</p>
<p>	I will myself to stand up, knowing the guards could come bursting out of those gray doors any second. I look around trying to figure out where to go. My leg feels as though it is on fire, so running too far is out of the picture.</p>
<p>	I half limp, half stumble to a large steel dumpster with a closed lid. Feeling weak, I barely manage to lift the lid and scramble my way inside. As soon as the lid of the dumpster closes back on top of me, I hear the gray doors slam open. I hold the pistol in front of me, hoping there are a few bullets left in it for when they open the dumpster lid.</p>
<p>	I can hear the men mill around in the alley for a second, and then through the lid I hear one of their muffled voices ask, “Which way do you think he went?”</p>
<p>	Another answers, “I don't know, but I ain't going to bother with chasing him. It is raining too hard. We put a bullet in his leg so he might bleed to death, or he will get picked up by one of our patrols later. We are not telling the boss about this one, okay? I am not having this come down on my head.”</p>
<p>	I hear silence for a few seconds, then the doors slam closed.</p>
<p>	Breathing a sigh of relief, I lay quietly in the dumpster. As the adrenaline coursing through me begins to diminish, the pain in my arm and leg begins to amplify. The knife had gone deep into my arm, but the bullet wound in my leg hurts much worse.</p>
<p>	After rummaging around a bit in the smelly dumpster trying to be as quiet as possible, I find a discarded rag. It seems large enough to take care of my arm and leg, so I rip it in half. I wrap half of the rag around my arm and make it as tight as I can to staunch the flow of blood.</p>
<p>	Gingerly, I reach down to check my leg and feel a great deal of warm liquid coming out of the wound. It is hard to tell in the dark, but it feels as though the bullet just grazed me and did not bury itself inside. It hurts like hell. I wrap the rest of the bandage tightly around my leg and try to decide on my next move.</p>
<p>	I escaped, but I can not stay here long in case they change their mind and come looking for me. I need to move while it is still raining since my leg and arm are bleeding. Once the rain stops, all they will need to do is follow the blood trail.</p>
