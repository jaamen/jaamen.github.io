<h3> Chapter 6 </h3>
<p>Cautiously, I push up on the lid of the dumpster to get a better look at my surroundings. I am unable to see much through the rain and darkness, except a brick wall on the opposing side of the alley. The alley seems to be deserted.</p>
<p>I push up a little more on the lid, and am able to see distant yellow streetlights marking where the alley ends and the street begins. No one is in sight, so I roll over the top of the dumpster and fall into the rain-soaked night.</p>
<p>	Pain shoots like lightning up my leg as my feet sink into the muddy ground. I begin limping away from the building where I almost lost my life. The illumination from the streetlight grows brighter, and I think how much has changed in so little time.</p>
<p>	I went from a bored student studying for finals to a fugitive trying to escape from a group of men who are trying to overtake the city. I killed one of them, but it was self-defense.</p>
<p>	I did not yet know how to feel about what I had done. I attacked the man first, but I had to escape or there is a good chance I would have ended up dead.</p>
<p>	Finally reaching the end of the alley, I look back toward the dumpster and the building. My staggered footsteps are slowly fading away as the rain continuously pounds on the muddy ground. The blood dripping from my arm and leg washes into the ruts made by my feet and dilutes to nothing.</p>
<p>	The rain should wash away my blood trail so no one will be able to track me. I have to put distance between me and the building before the rain stops.</p>
<p>	I glance around the corner of the building I am standing beside and look out of the alley and onto a main road. The sight greeting me sends a chill down my spine, and my mouth drops open in disbelief.</p>
<p>	Cars lay in pileups, smashed together and stopped at random and odd angles down the length of the street. Smoke pours from the engines of a few of them and raises up through the rain to meet the smoke coming from the buildings smoldering next to them. A few small buildings look as though they recently had roaring fires in them before the heavy rain began falling, turning them into crumbling, charred heaps of rubble.</p>
<p>	In the near distance I can see a few skyscrapers. The Bank of Bakersville Tower rises above the other skyscrapers. I must be on the outskirts of the downtown area. Dimly lit by the streetlight, I count at least eight bodies lying at random in the street, riddled with bullet holes.</p>
<p>	The bodies are those of men and women, and they are wearing casual clothing. They seem to have been going about a normal day before they were cut down by gunfire.</p>
<p>	What happened here? I must have been asleep for days. This destruction could not have taken place overnight.</p>
<p>	Suddenly, the roar of an engine in the distance grows louder as it nears my position. I am unsure if I should flag it down or to hide. It could be someone that can help me, but it could also be one of those patrols the guards were talking about.</p>
<p>	Cautiously, I poke my head out hoping to get a better view of the vehicle. A black SUV turns onto the street I am looking down and drives towards me. I need medical attention badly. Hopefully, it is someone who can help me.</p>
<p>	I am about to step into the SUV's view when the driver deliberately swerves to his left and there is a sickening sound as his tires connect with a dead woman lying in the street. The front end of the SUV bounces in the air initially, then the back end jerks up as the rear wheels hit the corpse. Her body rolls a few feet from the impact and comes to rest face down in a puddle of muddy water.</p>
<p>	Disgusted and gagging, I recede back into the shadows of the alley as the SUV flies past. I have just enough time to look in the window to catch the sight of one of the passengers and the driver. The two men are both wearing body armor and helmets similar to ones I had seen earlier this night. They would have shot me instead of helping me. I will have to watch out for more patrols.</p>
<p>	Even more cautious now, I look down the alley and see the next piece of cover I can hide behind in case another patrol comes by. I limp over to a car that has smashed its front end into the side of a building. The driver's head is covered in blood and resting on the steering wheel. The lifeless eyes are affixed in a permanent stare. I have seen way too much death tonight, I just hope I will not have to face my own.</p>
<p>	I hobble from cover to cover until I make it to the intersection with another street. Occasionally, as I move from one cover to the next, I check the bodies hoping to find someone still alive. None of them show any signs of life.</p>
<p>	Ducking down behind another wrecked car, I see a row of televisions for sale inside the window of a pawn shop. They are all tuned to the same station and all portray the same gruesome picture.</p>
<p>	A man, most likely the anchorman, is slumped back into his chair. He has a hole in his forehead that has now stopped leaking blood, because it is all over the counter in front of him. His face is unrecognizable from the blood and the bullet hole. Yet this sight is not the one that draws my attention. 	The news feed on the bottom of the screen continues even though the newscaster is silent. A small symbol in the upper left corner says, "Live Breaking News." They must have started playing the news when the attack began, but that newscaster never got a chance to finish his story.</p>
<p>	The news feed on the bottom of the screen reads, "UNKNOWN ASSAILANTS ATTACK CITY." This one fades away and is replaced by a new one, "THE 205 MEMBERS OF CONGRESS CURRENTLY IN THE CITY ARE BEING HELD HOSTAGE INSIDE OF THE BAKERSVILLE CONVENTION CENTER. DISAGREEMENTS ABOUT THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION HAS LED TO THE DELAY OF MILITARY DEPLOYMENT. THE ASSAILANTS ARE ASKING FOR A BILLION DOLLLARS FOR EACH HOSTAGE THEY RELEASE AND SAFE TRAVEL OUT OF THE COUNTRY."</p>
<p>	The next one appears, "THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS OUTSIDE OF THE CITY HAVE STATED THAT UNTIL THEY CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON HOW TO RESPOND TO THIS ATTACK, NO MILITARY ACTION WILL BE TAKEN. THE HYDE BILL PREVENTS ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FROM INTERVENING UNTIL THE ACTIVE CONGRESSIONAL MEMBERS HAVE REACHED A DECISION."</p>
<p>	The next one reads, "THE PEOPLE INSIDE THE..." This last ticker never finishes. Then the one I saw first reappears on the screen.</p>
<p>	I guess the guy who writes the news feed met the same fate as the anchorman. I can not believe that congress would not be able to come to an agreement about saving one of their own cities or even their own members. I know this has not been the most decisive congress in history, but this seems ridiculous.</p>
<p>	Before the passage of the Hyde Bill, the President could have ordered troops in here. Now, his hands are tied until all the congressmen not in the city can come to a decision, and who knows how long that will take?</p>
<p>	I am not sure who these people are, or why they would want to overtake this city, but I will have to deal with that later. Right now, I need to take care of my wounds.</p>
<p>	Blood continues to seep through the make-shift bandages and drip onto the ground. A grocery store or pharmacy is what I need to find so I can get proper dressings for these wounds.</p>
<p>	Continuing down the street, I move cautiously and watch for patrols. I do not recognize this area of downtown so I am really unsure where I am going. I used to come to this part of the city only rarely since it is such a long drive from my house.</p>
<p>	Keeping my eyes peeled, I look for some kind of store that might sell first aid supplies, but all I can see are office buildings and apartments in every direction. I dive behind a totaled car lying sideways on the sidewalk as the lights of yet another patrol wash over the area where I stood just moments before.</p>
<p>	At the very least, if I can not find medical supplies, a place to hide up for the night would be my next best option. These office buildings would be too hard to break into, especially in my weakened state. A construction site would be a perfect place to hide, and probably have some loose rags to freshen up my bandages.</p>
<p>	I come to the end of a row of office buildings. I had been wondering why there seemed to be such a large gap between the set of buildings I was next to and the ones in the distance. Now I had my answer.</p>
<p>	A river slices through the downtown area like an ax, separating the east side from the west. It is not a very wide river, but it is definitely wide enough to pose a problem. A bridge spans the two banks of the river and stretches out in front of me.</p>
<p>	In normal circumstances, the travel time across the bridge would seem insignificant, but in a situation such as this the distance seems vast and my crossing time will be extremely dangerous due to the frequent patrols.</p>
<p>	I consider backtracking, but after surveying the buildings across the river for a moment, one looks unfinished. It has a crane next to it and seems to be a construction site. That would be a great place to hide.</p>
<p>	I stand for a few minutes wondering if getting to the construction site is worth the risk, and decide I need to find somewhere to lay low and tend to my wounds. If not, the patrols will soon find me passed out on the ground.</p>
<p>	Listening to see if I can detect any sound of engines in the distance, I can only detect the roaring water from the river below and the rain continually pounding the cement around me.</p>
<p>	Eventually, I decide the only way to go is forward and begin limping across the bridge as fast as I can. A quarter of the way across, I look back and am reassured to see no trace of vehicle lights. So far, so good, I think as I push myself to go faster even though the wound in my leg burns like fire.</p>
<p>	About halfway across the bridge, I hear a sound that makes my blood run cold. A barely audible roar of an engine reaches my ears from the direction I had just come.</p>
<p>	I try to go even faster, but my wounds and tired body burn in protest. I look back to see the headlights from the vehicle come into view as it turns onto the street leading up to the bridge. I hobble as fast as I can with the adrenaline from fear pumping through me. I am just a little past halfway on the bridge when I look back to see how close the SUV is from me. I am not going to make it.</p>
<p>	The bridge is clean compared to the streets I was on before. It is devoid of any cars and offers not a single place to hide. I limp over to the side of the bridge thinking I can either hang off the edge to hide, or I can jump. As soon as I get a good look at how far down it is to the rushing water, I immediately back away with a sudden feeling of vertigo. The bridge is much higher than I had first thought.</p>
<p>	The roar of the water mixing with the sound of the rain creates a symphony in my ears, but it is interrupted by the unnatural roar of the SUV's engine. Looking at the side of the bridge, I realize there is nothing to hold onto, so hanging off the side to get out of sight is not feasible. My only options now are to jump or allow the men in the SUV to capture me.</p>
<p>	Standing next to the railing, I try to will myself to jump. My legs feel like jelly and will not move. The SUV's engine changes pitch as it speeds up. They have seen me!</p>
<p>	I do not know what to do. I keep trying to get myself to jump into the water, but I can not do it. It is too far down. The SUV slams on its breaks next to me and skids to a stop. One last time I peer into the water and make my decision.</p>
<p>	I put my hands in the air and turn towards the SUV. I give up, I could not get myself to make the jump.</p>
<p>	Hopefully, they will not identify me as the guy who escaped their prison and killed one of their men. I decided that taking my chances with these soldiers was a much safer idea than jumping into the crashing water below. I hope I made the right decision.</p>
<p>	A man in body armor opens the door of the SUV and steps into the rain drenched night. He already has his pistol out of its holster and in his hands. He levels the pistol at my chest. I am expecting him to come over and put me in handcuffs, but I am dead wrong.</p>
<p>	I feel something tear into my chest at the same time I hear the sound of a deafening explosion split the night. The realization I have just been shot in the chest hits me almost immediately after the bullet does.</p>
<p>	The impact from the bullet causes me to fall back against the railing of the bridge. I teeter on the rounded top of the short railing for a second, and I am unable to stop myself as I topple over into the air. The bridge grows smaller in my sight as I fall towards the rushing water below. I have just enough time to see the man who shot me come into sight as he peers over the edge of the bridge.</p>
<p>	I plunge into the chilly, turbulent water with a large splash. The current pulls me beneath the bridge and out of sight of the soldiers as I float back to the surface. A rock bumps into my body, and I feel myself slipping into unconsciousness.</p>
<p>	I grasp onto the rock with the last of my remaining strength to stop myself from being swept away by the current and seen on the other side of the bridge.</p>
<p>	Distant shouts reach my ears. A voice says, "Did you get him?" Another responds, "Yeah, I got him. There's no way he survived that shot." Then the first voice says, "Alright, let's get out of here."</p>
<p>	I hear car doors slam, and the sound of the SUV's engine recede into the distance. I reach over to my chest and feel where I was shot. It seems like the man's aim was not as true as he thought, hitting me more in the shoulder than in the chest.</p>
<p>	Blood pours out of my wound, and I know I have to do something to stop the bleeding. My breath is short, and I have to gasp for air. I feel my consciousness rapidly slipping away. I have to do something fast.</p>
<p>	I grab a large clump of mud from the riverbank and slap it onto the place the bullet entered my body. The fresh mud pressed into my wound intensifies the pain, but the flow of blood seems to be staunched. That will have to do for now.</p>
<p>	Finally, I no longer have the strength to hold on as my fingers slowly slip off the slick, mossy surface of the rock. I feel myself slowly drift downstream. The rain continues to pound the surface of the water as I lose consciousness.</p>
