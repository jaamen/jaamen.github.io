<h3> Chapter 4 </h3>
<p>I walk out of the bathroom wondering who could be knocking on my door at eleven o'clock at night. Maybe it is the police with some more questions about the shooting. I keep the chain bolt in place as I prepare to open the door.
	
	My apartment is not located in the best of neighborhoods, and I do not want some drugged out junkie barging into my apartment. I should have installed that peephole I thought about getting a few months ago. I open the door only as wide as the chain bolt allows to let me to see who is on the other side.
	
	Splinters fly as the chain bolt is ripped out of the wall, and the door shoots like a rocket into my face. I see stars as the door connects with my body. The impact knocks me back into my bookshelf that sits next to the door. Shelves and books fall with me to the floor in a heap.
	
	Men in body armor storm into my apartment and pin me to the ground before I have any time to react. I can not get a good look at them because they are pressing my face to the ground. I hear a zipping sound and feel my hands forced together by a thin but strong plastic strap.
	
	Someone grabs my head and forces it up off the ground. The last thing I see is a black bag as it is thrown over my head. After this, I have to rely on my other senses to figure out what is happening.
	
	A strong hand grasps my arm and pulls me to my feet. I feel myself being led out of the apartment. One of the men says "Stairs," and I almost fall as my next step is about eight inches lower than the last. We continue down the three flights of steps to the ground floor.
	I try to ask the man grabbing my arm, "What is going on?" but as soon as the words come out of my mouth, pain shoots through my stomach. I double over as a gruff voice says, “Unless you want to get hit again, I suggest you shut your mouth.”
	Helpless, I allow myself to be led down the stairs. The sound of traffic is audible in the distance as soon as we step outside. The next thing I hear is the sound of an opening car door.
	My body is heavily shoved into the back seat without a chance for me to sit myself down. The door is slammed behind me, and I hear and feel the car accelerate as it drives down the street with me in the back.
	Sitting by myself in the back seat staring into a black bag with no other sound than the roaring engine of the vehicle, I am forced to take a moment to collect my thoughts. It is hard to do, though, when those thoughts are racing so quickly around in my head.
	Does this have something to do with the shooting I saw earlier? Do the police think I had something to do with it? Do they think I was responsible? There were enough other witnesses to verify I had nothing to do with it. What do the police want with me?
	As these thoughts work themselves out in my head, I begin to calm down. Once the police realize I had nothing to do with the murder they will let me go. This whole mess will sort itself out.
	The next thought I have feels like a chunk of ice has been dropped into my already aching gut: I do not even know if these people are the police. They seemed to be wearing gear that cops would wear when storming a building, but I do not remember seeing any badges or lettering on the gear.
	Why would they need that kind of equipment to arrest someone like me anyway? They can not think I am dangerous? My hands felt as though they were zip tied together, not hand cuffed. That does not seem like standard procedure for the police. Also, why would the police put a black bag over someone's head?
	I begin to think maybe I am not dealing with the police, and I might be in for a much worse experience than first expected.
	I feel the car lurch to a stop, and wait lying on the seat. The front doors open and close, followed by the back door opening. A strong hand latches onto my arm and drags me bodily out of the car. There is nothing I can do other than allow myself be led wherever my captors want me to go.
	After a short walk, the sound of the traffic fades out behind me, and I sense we are now inside some type of building. We continue for a few more minutes and changes direction five times. After this, we stop. The black bag is pulled off of my head.
	I blink as my eyes begin to adjust to the change in light. My hands are freed from their binds, and then I am patted down. They find nothing on me, though, because I was getting ready to go to bed. If only I had grabbed my cell phone, I might have been able to call for help.
	A man I do not get a chance to see shoves me into a small white room and slams the door. I look around to get my bearings. My eyes are burning from the transition of the blackness in the bag to the industrial white glare of the fluorescent lights overhead.
	When my eyes finally do adjust, there is not much to look at. A green cot is shoved up against one wall, but other than that the small room I alone occupy is bare. Whitewashed cement walls fill up the rest of the room. The metal door is the only feature on the wall behind me. The ceiling, except for the light, looks almost identical to the walls. The floor is white linoleum.
	I walk over to the door and yank as hard as I can on the handle. It is locked tight.
	This room does not look like it was originally designed to be a holding cell. It looks like it used to be a storage closet. Why do they need a make-shift cell for someone like me? I move over to the cot and sit down. As I take a deep breath I think, What the hell is going on?
	After waiting for a short while, the door opens and a guard in body armor enters the room. He is dressed exactly like the ones who stormed my apartment. I am unable to read his facial expression because a helmet with a mask covers his face. He motions with his assault rifle that I should go where he tells me.
	The guard leads me down a long white corridor lined with closed doors on both sides. We walk to a door no different than all the others lining the lengthy hallway. The guard opens the door, and we enter a room similar to the one I had recently left. This room is larger and instead of a cot a stainless steel table with a chair on either side fills the center of the room.
	A strong hand forces me down into the chair and then the guard leaves me alone in the room. I hear the sound of a lock turning, and I know I can do nothing but stay put. A cup of black coffee sits on the table in front of me. I pick up the coffee and take a sip to calm my nerves, then I wait to see what happens next.
	After only a few minutes, I hear the door unlock behind me and open. A man in a black suit with a briefcase walks around to the opposite side of table. He sets his briefcase down on the steel table. He is tall and gaunt, and has a hollow look. His thin face is clean shaven and the widow's peak of his black hair points down to two squinting eyes. The man seems to size me up quickly before taking a seat in the chair opposite of mine.
	“I'll bet you're wondering why you are here,” the man states in a crisp monotone voice.
	“Yes, I do,” I reply in the nicest way possible. This man has me in his power right now, and he is probably armed. It will be to my best interest not to anger him, and to do what he says.
	“First of all, introductions. My name is Mr. Samuel. And you are?”
	“Mark Stetson,” I reach out to shake the man's hand, but his hands do not move from under the table. His gaze drops down to my hand stretched across the table with a look of contempt before his eyes lock back with mine. I retreat my hand back into my own lap, feeling even more uneasy than I did before.
	“I don't want this to be a waste of my time, so I need you to cooperate and keep your mouth shut until I ask you to speak,” Samuel curtly commands. Then he asks, “Did you tell anyone about the shooting you saw earlier today?”
	I try to make my voice sound strong, but it is hard when I am becoming more bewildered by the second. “Only the police officer who I gave my statement to. I think his name was Callahan or something like that. He was the only one I told.”
	“So you said nothing that would even hint at the shooting to anyone?"
	"No, I didn't even talk to anyone the rest of the day. I was studying for a final exam."
	"I hope you are being honest with me, Mark. It will not bode well for you if you are lying to us. The officer you speak of has been dealt with, and all the other witnesses of the shooting have already been brought in. Most of them are in similar meetings around the building as we speak.”
	I do not know what to think of the information I was just given, so I attempt to ask, “Why is everyone being rounded up like this?” As soon as the words come out of my mouth, I realize it was not a good idea to be asking questions. Samuel looks at me with impatience.
	He barks, “I told you to be quiet and only speak when I told you. I will indulge you for a few seconds, though. It does not matter anyway if I tell you now, because in just a few hours the attack will begin. We are going to take over this city, and kill anyone who gets in our way."
	I am in shock at what he just told me, but there is nothing I can do but listen.
	Samuel continues, "The man who was shot at the restaurant was a government agent who at one point worked for us, but he defected to the other side. He was going to give the information over to other government officials in an attempt to stop the attack. We could not let that happen, so we took him out. Oh, and the man who retrieved the briefcase was one of ours. He only impersonated a government agent to keep that briefcase from falling into the wrong hands.”
	Samuel reaches into his coat jacket and slowly pulls out a handgun. The black metal sounds heavy and very real as he sets it down on the table in front of him.
	He says, "I would kill you right now if I thought you were lying to me, but I do not think you are. You seem to live a pretty lonely existence from what we could find out about you in so little time." I wince at the truth in his words, but the sight of the gun forces me to stay calm.
	Samuel stands up from the table and says, “We will keep you around as long as you might turn out to be of some use to us, but for now we have to keep you here. We wouldn't want you to run your mouth and alert certain people as to what we are planning on doing. We want this task to be executed as smoothly as possible, and we are not going to let someone as unimportant as you make our task harder than is necessary. You will wait in your room for a few days, then if you choose to help us, we might be able to use you. If you chose not to help us, then you will be disposed of. It is up to you. Choose wisely.”
	Samuel picks his gun up from the table and returns it to his holster. Right before he steps out, he looks at me and says, "That coffee you drank was drugged. You should be asleep for a few days time to keep you out of our hair. Do not be alarmed if you feel woozy." Without another word he leaves.
	I look down at my coffee and see more than half of it is gone. Drugged? Asleep for a few days?What is happening?
	As soon as he steps out, the guard in the armor returns. He grabs my arm and leads me back to my cell. I lay down on the cot and try to figure out why I am here, what is going on, and what Samuel was talking about. What did he mean?
	I lay on my cot when suddenly I begin to feel extremely drowsy. The florescent light on the ceiling begins to sway back in forth in my vision. My body feels very heavy and my eyelids slowly close.
